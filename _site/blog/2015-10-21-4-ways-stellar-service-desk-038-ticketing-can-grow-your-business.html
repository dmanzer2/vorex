<p>From saving time to increasing efficiency, here are four ways stellar service desk and ticketing can help you grow your business.</p>

<h3 id="1-less-time-to-close-tickets">1. Less Time to Close Tickets</h3>

<p>In business, time is money, and the less time spent tending to tickets, the more you’ll have of both. With a PSA that includes key RMM integrations, you can track, update and close tickets much more quickly than with more traditional PSA solutions.</p>

<h3 id="2-operational-efficiency">2. Operational Efficiency</h3>

<p>Because integration allows tickets to be tended to across platforms, greater operational efficiency and customer satisfaction results. As <a href="http://www.businesstrainingworks.com/training-company/kate-zabriskie">Kate Zabriskie</a> stated, “The customer’s perception is your reality.” Nowhere is this more true than when customer service needs are speedily resolved, so you and your customers can happily move on to more pressing matters.</p>

<h3 id="3-track-billable-hours">3. Track Billable Hours</h3>

<p>Keeping accurate track of billable hours is essential to growing your business, but in the realm of service desk and ticketing, it’s easy to sometimes lose the forest for the trees. When your PSA streamlines service desk and ticketing details, however, the forest and the trees can remain in focus–but not because you’re focused on them.</p>

<h3 id="4-the-noc">4. The NOC</h3>

<p>Remote monitoring and management is only as good as the people and software behind it. With an RMM solution that includes a <a href="http://www.continuum.net/solutions/rmm-software/noc">Network Operations Center</a> (NOC), technical and customer support are online and working on your behalf every minute of every day.</p>

<p>An NOC can tend to–and close–as many as 90% of your routine tickets. How much could your business grow in the face of such assistance?</p>

<p>Give the people what they want, and grow your business at the same time. With a stellar service desk and ticketing solution, the two are one and the same.</p>
