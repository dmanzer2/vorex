Beginning in 2008, [Jewell Computing Solutions](http://www.jewellcomputing.com/) faced a serious challenge: after years of successfully offering [break-fix IT solutions](http://www.mspanswers.com/2012/02/10/17-reasons-why-providing-breakfix-support-will-kill-your-it-support-business/), the company aimed to start offering [managed services](http://www.jewellcomputing.com/why-should-your-company-use-managed-services/).

For a [microfirm](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/entrepreneur_aag-2013-en/02/01/index.html?contentType=&itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fchapter%2Fentrepreneur_aag-2013-7-en&mimeType=text%2Fhtml&containerItemId=%2Fcontent%2Fserial%2F22266941&accessItemIds=) like Jewell Computing Solutions, this transition would not be easy. [Nearly 88% of all IT solution providers](http://vorex.hs-sites.com/vorex-success-story-jewell?__hstc=100746398.1ae0f305efe0ac392cdb84ffbd2439be.1440771548482.1440771548482.1440777084249.2&__hssc=100746398.11.1440777084249&__hsfp=2218285620) are companies comprised of 10 or fewer employees, and Jewell could fluctuated between five and 20 employees at any given time.<!--more-->

Making the jump to offering managed services would require additional [professional services automation (PSA)](http://www.vorex.com/whats-the-difference-between-project-management-and-psa/) and [remote monitoring and management (RMM)](http://www.vorex.com/change-your-business-with-new-vorex-features/) tools to manage its billing&#8211;tools that can be costly and inefficient for smaller organizations.

**Overly Complex&#8211;and Wasteful**

&#8220;We made our first investment in PSA in 2008, and it was so complex and configurable that I would have to spend 80 hours a week for three consecutive months setting up the tools for our business,&#8221; says Jeffrey Jewell, founder and president of Jewell Computing Solutions, &#8220;and I just didn&#8217;t have the resources to do that. As the result, the tool never got used and the investment was a complete waste.&#8221;

[Effective time and resource management is key to the success of a microfirm](http://www.vorex.com/success-on-a-shoestring-3-strategies-for-time-strapped-business-leaders/). With less to invest, managing overhead can be the difference between a business&#8217; healthy growth and failure. Paying for tools that are overly complex or needlessly configurable is an inefficiency that small businesses can&#8217;t afford.

**Simplify with SaaS**

After another failed attempt with a cumbersome PSA tool, Jewell was contacted by Vorex, and in September 2014, began a pilot test of a new PSA.

&#8220;The first thing we noticed,&#8221; says Jewell, &#8220;was how much simpler this solution was to set up than our previous PSA. Vorex uses a [SaaS model](http://technologyadvice.com/project-management/blog/on-premise-vs-cloud-project-management-software/), which means we don&#8217;t need to invest in a dedicated server, and we don&#8217;t have to worry about patches and updates. We can access the solution from any web browser, and every time we login we&#8217;re using the most up-to-date version.&#8221;

Streamlining the billing process provides a more accurate view of the resources and time being committed to a customer. SaaS business management solutions [like Vorex&#8217;s](http://www.vorex.com/product/) enable easy remote access&#8211;meaning a consultant can update their time and expense tracking throughout the day, from anywhere.

**Growth Through More Accurate Billing**

Within months, Jewell was seeing dramatic results in its bottom-line.

&#8220;Our monthly billing has increased between 25% and 30%,&#8221; says Jewell, &#8220;and that&#8217;s not due to onboarding new clients.&#8221;

The increase was because the Vorex PSA allowed engineers and technicians to more easily account for all billable activities. Miscalculating, underreporting and haphazard tracking of billable hours accounts can result in a company losing [nearly $50,000 a year per employee](http://blog.hourstimetracking.com/you-could-be-wasting-50000-a-year-by-not-tracking-your-time/).

The key to preventing this is creating a [&#8220;culture of consistent time tracking&#8221;](http://cewilsonconsulting.com/7-smart-tips-effective-time-tracking/) within the company. Jewell Computing Solutions was able to more easily track time and resource allocation by utilizing the more user-friendly and simplified Vorex PSA.

**Increase Billables with Automation**

While for decades manual billing was the industry standard, recent studies have shown that [&#8220;manual processes around client billing can cause error rates of 12%-15%.&#8221;](http://www.aberdeen.com/research/8702/ai-project-resource-scheduling/content.aspx) Automation can help prevent these losses in billables.

&#8220;Vorex makes it easier to enter each billable activity by providing us with a single view of our customers and automatically sending us reminders if anything is missing,&#8221; says Jewell.

Streamlining time and expense tracking and automation [eases the hassle and upping the accuracy of the billing process](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237895). The success of Jewell Computing Solutions is built on the effective implementation of the [Vorex PSA platform](http://www.vorex.com/industries/architecture-engineering-construction/), designed so a company can be free to focus on operations and customer service, the cornerstones of a prosperous enterprise.
