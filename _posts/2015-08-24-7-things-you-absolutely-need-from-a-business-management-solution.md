The hallmarks of a good PR and marketing agency are the same as they were before the Internet invaded our every waking moment: Good storytelling, compelling imagery and creativity are still vital tools of the trade.

As the Internet becomes [increasingly central](http://www.statista.com/chart/1971/electronic-media-use/) to life, however, marketers and PR firms have had to shift gears. *Selling* is out. *Sharing* is in. Today’s best agencies emphasize making connections between their clients, their clients’ customers and the media–social and otherwise.

**Happiness as a Solution**

If, as Don Draper suggested, happiness is both the basis of advertising and that “…moment before you need more happiness,” achieving those connections requires relentless effort. Thankfully, how work gets done, tracked, recorded, billed and collaborated on in the Internet Age has been revolutionized.

You can streamline your agency’s day-to-day with a business management solution, but make sure these seven essentials are in place before you choose which solution is the perfect match.

1. **1. True, Real-time Visibility**

Any business management solution should offer real-time visibility into the scope and specificity of your agency’s projects. Hold out for a visual platform so you can see who is working on what and which stage each project is in. Anything less will be one more software program to manage.

1. **2. Integration**

If your business management solution doesn’t integrate all the services you need under one software roof, look elsewhere. Integrated project management, resource allocation, time and expense tracking, invoicing, CRM  and the like will save you time, money and stress from having to jump among different programs and compare notes.

1. **3. Resource Allocation**

When you put the right people on the right projects, they’re more engaged, and their projects fare better. If [happy employees](http://www.fastcompany.com/3048751/the-future-of-work/happy-employees-are-12-more-productive-at-work) really can boost a company’s productivity by 12%, you need a business management solution that assists you in placing people where they’re at their best.

1. **4. CRM**

Any business management solution worth its salt will make it easy for you to keep accurate records of all current, past and potential customers. A dynamic customer relationship management feature won’t just help generate leads, it will also ensure your relationship with [your most important customers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/stanphelps/2014/08/18/five-customer-centric-marketing-lessons-from-apple-to-zappos/)–the ones you already have–stays strong.

1. **5. Easy-to-Use**

To lift your agency out of the mire of day-to-day operational activities, you need a business management solution that’s straightforward and easy-to-use. A steep learning curve won’t just create headaches, it might also [foster negative attitudes among your team](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/adverse-effects-bad-attitude-workplace-18249.html). Choose a solution that’s intuitive and simple.

1. **6. Scalability**

Growth should be a natural result of streamlining work through a business management solution. So, make sure the software you’re leaning on for that growth is scalable. Without true scalability, increased productivity and results will yield more growing pains than revenue.

1. **7. Project Management**

PR and marketing agencies often have [multiple projects in multiple stages](http://www.innovatenewalbany.org/business/agency-life-manage-multiple-projects/) at all times, which makes work interesting, albeit complex. With a project management feature, you’ll have visibility into the intricacies of your team’s various projects at any given time. That deep-level project insight will help you stay on budget in terms of both time and money.

For PR and marketing agencies, your reputation is your greatest asset. Keep it intact by choosing a business management solution that can produce the same high-level results as you. **For more insight into how to grow your agency successfully, download our free ebook,** [***The Agency’s Scale Problem: How to Blast Through the $1M Ceiling***](http://vorex.hs-sites.com/agency-scale-ebook?__hstc=100746398.b2843db0333d5242d1d7cad84e1e93d1.1428948442272.1440111637810.1440179151803.64&amp;__hssc=100746398.3.1440179151803&amp;__hsfp=3345652249)**.**
