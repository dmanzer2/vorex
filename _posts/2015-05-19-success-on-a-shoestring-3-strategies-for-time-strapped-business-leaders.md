Running a small- or medium-sized business (SMB) comes with the jumbo-sized responsibility of juggling multiple administrative responsibilities, projects and timelines. And with small businesses making up [99.7% of U.S. employers](https://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/FAQ_Sept_2012.pdf), it comes as no surprise that most American business owners are overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work required to run their businesses efficiently.<!--more-->

Unfortunately, without the right systems in place, leading your team to success can mean frustrating days, late nights, and working on the weekends. So how do successful business owners manage it all without working their lives away?

Let&#8217;s take a look at a few of the tried and true leadership strategies that work for organizations of all sizes.

 **1. Communicate Clearly: Set Realistic Expectations**

At the beginning of any project, it&#8217;s important to communicate clear objectives and realistic deadlines to every person on the team so they know what is expected of them. By taking out the guesswork, employees will be empowered to focus on completing the task at hand and working collaboratively toward a common goal.

Giving your team the knowledge they need to do their work accurately and concisely results in a less stressful work environment, which benefits everyone. And we&#8217;re not talking micromanaging here &#8212; the most successful organizations are those that:

  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Give</span> their team members the information they need,
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Set</span> clear boundaries,
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Communicate</span> project deadlines, and
  * <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Provide</span> a system for efficient workflows.

 **2. Get Organized: Make Lists**

While this might seem like archaic advice, there are few things as gratifying as completing a to-do list. Encourage your team to make daily or weekly to-do lists of all the tasks at hand for any particular project.

To-do lists on sticky notes or within Word docs are fine, but using a project management platform to keep lists organized creates an actionable environment where your team&#8217;s to-do lists can live in a single location to help maintain cohesive and transparent team communication.

Make sure to pay special attention to prioritizing tasks that require more time or call for collaboration with other team members. Not only do prioritized lists promote efficient workflows, they also encourage individuals to be accountable for their portion of the project.

 **3. Save Time: Automate Tasks**

Because most businesses work within limited resources and lack the staff of a larger enterprise, time management is essential to the success of every project.

One way to save time across the board is to implement [project management tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/) that help improve workflows and automate those tasks that waste your team&#8217;s precious time (think billing and project time estimates).

Small business managers everywhere understand the challenges that come with trying to motivate a team to get to the next level, but sometimes the simplest workflow edits can make the most impact!
