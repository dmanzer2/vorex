Choosing an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for your organization can be a big decision. For starters, transitioning from an ad hoc system of resource planning and allocation to [one centralized company-wide system](http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/) is bound to come with a learning curve. Plus, there are costs to consider and complexity of implementation.

Choosing the right ERP solution can have a major impact on how smooth your transition is. The system you choose will also have a major bearing on how quickly you’ll be able to reap the benefit of an organized, centralized ERP.<!--more-->

You might be asking: with all the options available today, how can I tell if the ERP solution I’m considering will be a good fit for my company? While there are [some great guides out there](http://www.cio.com/article/2458889/enterprise-resource-planning/9-tips-for-selecting-and-implementing-an-erp-system.html) on the web, we’ve distilled that information into one quick, easy-to-digest list of key considerations.

### Measure Twice, Cut Once

It seems obvious, but before you can choose the right ERP for your organization, you have to decide how you’ll define that connection. This typically involves working across all the different departments within your business to figure out exactly it is you need out of the software — as well as what you don’t want.

Brian Shannon, principal business process management architect at [Dolphin Enterprise Solutions](http://www.dolphin-corp.com/), says, “If you get one thing right, make it the up-front requirements gathering process.”

As Mr. Shannon says, “few things derail project budgets and timelines as the ‘assumptive’ or absent requirements.” That’s why it’s important to make sure you engage with every department that will have to rely on the software, as well as upper management, so that everyone can have some say in the process.

### Phone-a-Friend

[Enterprise software is like any other major purchase](http://www.informationweek.com/software/enterprise-applications/6-more-enduring-truths-about-selecting-enterprise-software/d/d-id/1113070?page_number=2). There are some things you can only learn about it after you’ve got it up and running. Just because you have a list of specs and requirements that you need to check off doesn’t mean that the solution will work well in your software ecosystem. That’s why it always pays to get some real user feedback before making your choice.

If you’re working with a vendor, ask them for some references, make a list of questions, and then reach out. Get feedback from similar organizations that have made the transition. Taking these steps can provide you with a wealth of insights you might otherwise never have access to until you’ve already committed. And by then, it could be too late!

### Check the Connections

We’d like to think that when it comes to modern connectivity, all enterprise software providers are up-to-date with current practices, but the truth is that many ERP platforms haven’t even made the move to the cloud yet. Research has shown that cloud-based ERP software and the always-online connectivity it offers is the wave of the future, and [adoption rates are growing even faster than predicted](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2014/02/07/why-cloud-erp-adoption-is-faster-than-gartner-predicts/).

Mobile integration, [cloud-based software](http://www.vorex.com/top-5-ways-cloud-based-project-management-provides-a-competitive-edge/) and seamless integration with your existing business software and workflows are all modern must-haves when it comes to ERP. So make sure the software you’re considering has high marks for connectivity. Without it, you might find yourself stuck in the stone-age and unable to scale your business and keep up with the competition.
