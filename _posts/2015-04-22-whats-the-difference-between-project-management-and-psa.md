We’re often tasked with explaining the difference between project management and professional services automation (PSA) when it comes to our business management solution. While each aspect serves a unique purpose and has a highly distinct audience, they both deliver the same benefits to small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs)- streamlined operations, improved business insights, increased productivity within the organization and, most importantly, increased profitability.

**The Benefits of Project Management**

As SMB owners face increasing demands on their time and resources (people, tools *and* money) while trying to run a successful company, they have little time to fine-tune operations to gain that all-important differentiation within their respective industries. For this reason, project management tools are starting to gather steam within the SMB market – especially considering less than a third of all projects were completed on time and on budget during the past year. In a [recent Software Advice survey](http://www.softwareadvice.com/project-management/buyerview/web-based-smb-report-2015/), 70 percent of prospective buyers currently use manual methods for their project management. One can see why less than 33 percent of projects crossed the finish line on time!

With [project management tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/), companies – especially professional services organizations (PSOs) like marketing and advertising agencies – have a better view of where all current projects stand at any given time. This oversight is enabled through real-time access to project statuses, keeping owners and managers in the know and eliminating the exhausting task of chasing down update after update across teams.

With better project insight, business owners can more effectively staff projects, improve budgeting and forecasting and easily recognize areas of growth – and areas of improvement – within the company. All of these capabilities help owners and managers better capture billing, identify more profitable projects for the organization, better service clients and, in the long-run, more effectively scale the company.

**So, what *is* PSA?**

At its core, PSA includes aspects of project management, plus quite a bit of added functionality. As the name denotes, it manages and automates a number of professional services such as accounting, help desk and ticketing, customer relationship management (CRM) and time and expense tracking, among others.

PSAs integrate with popular business software like QuickBooks to further optimize and automate processes. This ensures that businesses are not only capturing billable time and expenses more accurately in accordance with contracts and service level agreements (SLAs), but the billing and invoicing process is seamless – and painless – for SMB owners. A PSA solution also helps route the right person to the right project, helping increase customer satisfaction.

PSOs such as IT consultants and software services, managed service providers (MSPs) and value added resellers (VARs) notice a marked decrease in the time spent on business operations once they implement a PSA solution. This single integrated view of the entire company’s operations provides an invaluable snapshot of how the organization is performing against benchmarks and, similar to project management, helps owners and managers identify areas of improvement and growth.

With revenue growth slowing for SMBs – [it fell to just 10% in 2013](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140211005597/en/SPI%C2%A0Research-Professional-Services-Industry-Growth-Profit-Decline#.VS6PCGYqp-U), down from 11.5% the previous year – a business management platform that combines aspects of both project management and PSA can help companies push to that next level. By automating time-consuming processes and providing a high-level overview of company operations, project management and PSA tools allow company owners and managers to concentrate on delivering continuous service improvement and strategically growing the business. Who wouldn’t rather be out chasing their dreams than a status report?
