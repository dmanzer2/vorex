Owning and managing a [professional services organization (PSO)](http://www.vorex.com/industries/consulting-professional-services/) is both rewarding and challenging. Long hours and demanding work environments, when coupled with juggling various clients, managing multiple projects on different timelines and attempting to capture and invoice for every single billable hour, often becomes too much for business leaders to manage effectively.<!--more-->



According to the [2112 Group](http://the2112group.com/research/), 15% of PSOs reported no growth or reduced revenue, while 10% actually reported a net loss, in 2013. Those numbers are an indication of a business spiraling out of control.

While you might not realize you&#8217;re close to the edge, the good news is you&#8217;re not too far gone to correct your course and position your organization for success. Below are our four signs your business is spiraling out of control and how a [business management solution](http://www.vorex.com/product/) can help get you back on the right track.

  1.  **You Don&#8217;t Know Who&#8217;s Doing What**

Pop quiz: Which of your employees is booked solid? Who has room in their schedule to take on new work? Are enough people free for the next project?

If answering those questions takes you longer than a few mouse clicks, your current project management system is wasting your time and effort.

One of the [biggest challenges for project managers](https://kellycrew.wordpress.com/2011/01/10/top-10-issues-for-project-managers/) is the administrative side of project management &#8211; tracking who is working on what, how many hours they&#8217;ve put in, etc. But that data is essential to successful project management. Afterall, you can&#8217;t manage what you don&#8217;t know.



This is where [project management software](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) can help you keep track of the work that&#8217;s going on in your business without subjecting you to extra data entry. You&#8217;ll also get an at-a-glance view of who is working on what and who can take on a new project.

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <b> You Don&#8217;t Know How Much a Project Costs</b>
  </li>
</ol>

[Time and expense tracking](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/) are essential for effective project management, but doing the actual tracking can be tedious. Not having an accurate picture of how your team is using its time and how much you&#8217;re spending on projects not only puts you at a disadvantage when billing clients, it also hamstrings you during long-term planning.

[_Forbes_](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2012/10/24/5-simple-tips-to-keep-your-small-business-finances-in-order/) points out that personnel is likely your largest expense, so tracking employees&#8217; time easily provides a great overall snapshot of your business. Having time and expense data easily available can help you rightg a project that&#8217;s heading over budget.



When you&#8217;re looking for time and expense tracking solutions, [_Consumer Affairs_](http://www.consumeraffairs.com/business/expense-management-software/#buyers-guide) recommends finding software that lets employees enter their hours on their own from an online-based platform. A cloud-based solution makes it easy for every team member &#8211; whether they&#8217;re onsite or remote &#8211; to capture their hours and frees up project managers for more meaningful tasks.

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <b> You&#8217;re Spending too Much Time on Billing</b>
  </li>
</ol>

Companies that process invoices by hand spend [250% more](http://blog.billtrust.com/guest-blogger-how-much-are-your-invoices-actually-costing-you/) getting their bills out than companies with automated billing. While the old adage that you have to spend money to make money is true, spending so much on invoicing is wasteful.

Automating billing has two big benefits: First, it reduces errors in billing. (Hey, who hasn&#8217;t forgotten to carry a one? Actually, [88% of spreadsheets](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/88-of-spreadsheets-have-errors-2013-04-17) out there has errors, so bad bad is rampant.)

[Billing and invoicing software](http://www.vorex.com/product/billing-invoicing-tracking/) uses the information you and your team enter about projects and automatically turns it into an invoice for your customers, limiting the chance that poor math can affect the bills that are passed on to clients.

Second, automated invoicing saves time and money. Now, rather than paperwork, your team&#8217;s talents can be spent on projects that require a human touch.



<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <b> You Don&#8217;t Know Your Strengths and Weaknesses</b>
  </li>
</ol>

When you hire, you likely look for talent and skills that will strengthen your organization and make your team more well-rounded. But to have a solid team, you need to know what resources you need insight into your staff&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses.

While a quarterly office talent showcase would be fun, it&#8217;s not the most effective or efficient way to remind yourself of your employees&#8217; skill sets. Instead, use [resource management tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) to create team member profiles that include information like education, training, certifications and other skills.

No more guessing if someone with a particular skill is free to work on a new project &#8211; the information is right there for you. Because offering too much training in one area can actually [become counterproductive](http://scn.sap.com/community/business-trends/blog/2012/11/20/5-myths-about-human-capital-management).
