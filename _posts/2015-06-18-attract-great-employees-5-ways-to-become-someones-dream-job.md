Attracting top talent is key for any company, but it’s a prime consideration for smaller teams to help differentiate you in the marketplace. So how can the little guy stand out to these superstar candidates?

When you’re up against bigger companies that can offer higher salaries and robust benefit packages to secure highly qualified candidates, it’s important to build up the perks and bonuses that come along with working for your business.

But sometimes the little things can make all the difference – little things that don’t require the huge budget of a bonus package or other perks. Instead, here are five ways to add value to your offer letters and secure your place as a potential new hire’s dream job.

1. **\*\*Create a Company Library**\*\*

Have your team members help build the [company library](http://blog.robustsoftware.co.uk/2008/05/creating-company-library.html) by purchasing any business or industry-related books they’re interested in. Create a shareable document where team members can request new books they’d like to read by including a link to the Amazon page where the book can be found.

This is a great way to keep your team up-to-date on the newest trends and ideas in your industry while also building up your company’s internal library.

**Invest in Online Training**\*\*

\*\* Offer to pay the subscription fees to [Lynda](http://www.lynda.com/) or [Rosetta Stone](http://www.rosettastone.com/) so your team can learn a new language, crosstrain on a different department’s software or learn new business, creative and technology skills.

Paying for continuing education keeps your team engaged and demonstrates that you are committed to their professional development. Subscription-based training programs are reasonably priced and offer big value in return for their relatively low cost.

1. \*\* Communicate Effectively and Easily\*\*

There might be nothing more frustrating for employees than feeling like they don’t have visibility into projects at work. Eliminate the guessing games surrounding active projects within your organization and implement a [project management software](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) that keeps everyone in the loop and communicating efficiently.

Having an efficient way to manage and streamline  business processes ensures your team won’t get frustrated and can collaborate efficiently on every step along the way.

1. \*\* Stream Premium Music\*\*
   <br> These days, a lot of people listen to music while they work. For less than $10 a month, paying for your employees to have a premium music streaming subscription with Spotify, Rdio, Google Play, Beats, Rhapsody, or Pandora is a low cost way to add both value and fun to their days.

2. \*\* Implement Peer Review Lunch Bonuses\*\*

Do a modern twist on the “Employee of the Month” program, and allow the members of your team to vote for one another in a monthly peer review program.

Each team member can nominate someone they believe went above and beyond that month to get the job done. The person who receives the most nominations wins a gift card for $25 to their favorite lunch spot.

You can also look into signing on with an employee perk program like [Perkspot](http://www.perkspot.com/) or [Perks](http://perks.com/) for more ideas about creating value for your employees.

Choosing to work for a company is often as much about the work itself as it is about the culture and environment of an office. Investing a small amount of capital into building out your perk program can go a long way in attracting and retaining the talent you need to support your business.
