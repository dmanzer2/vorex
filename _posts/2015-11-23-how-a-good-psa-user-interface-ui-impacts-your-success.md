Ever feel like your business is in danger of being left behind by the times? Like the guy who’s still wearing bell-bottoms while everyone else has moved on to skinny jeans, are you still [manually tracking data and projects with spreadsheets](http://www.vorex.com/step-away-from-the-spreadsheets-how-diy-business-tracking-is-a-business-fail/), and updating information in multiple docs saved in different files?

Maybe the time has come for you to ‘get with it.’

Not everyone can or should pull off jeans that look two sizes too small, but by investing in a well-designed project management platform, you can move your business forward by reclaiming time that would’ve been previously wasted on duplicate efforts, fixing errors and manually tracking data.

When chosen carefully, the right solution can completely change the way your company does business. In fact, according to [a study by Aberdeen Group](http://aberdeen.com/research/8396/ra-professional-services-automation/content.aspx#sthash.0ap9boZ4.dpuf), “…Best-in-Class professional services firms are 77 percent more likely than all others to have implemented integrated Professional Services Automation (PSA) software.”

### Streamlining Operations with PSA

Just as updating your look can make you feel more in-step with the times, by consolidating business operations under one hub, every detail can be accessed in one place. And by storing and tracking all of your files, invoices, project updates and emails in one cloud-based platform, everyone within your organization will have access to what’s happening in real-time.

By keeping track of everything in one place, miscommunication is also less likely to occur, and that’s always a good thing. There’s nothing more frustrating to the people on your team than feeling out of the loop or misinformed.

A well-functioning Professional Services Automation (PSA) User Interface (UI) keeps your team up-to-speed on what’s going on with all your projects to help keep customer service levels high.

A unified project management solution with ERP and billing capabilities can also help your business automate simple operations like invoicing, resource planning, time tracking, project workflow and other day-to-day tasks.

### Key Elements of a Good User Interface in a PSA

While it’s easy enough to spot a good look in a magazine, knowing where to shop for that look can be a bit more challenging. The same goes for an effective PSA. But just as it is when it comes to fashion, knowing what constitutes a good UI in a PSA UI is important to identify before you start shopping around for a vendor.

Here are a few of the key features that define a good PSA/project management platform:

**Flexible Integration:** It’s important to choose a platform that integrates seamlessly with your existing bookkeeping software and email. Otherwise, it will be difficult, and maybe even impossible to get your employees on board with using the platform to its fullest capabilities.

**A User-Friendly UI:** A good project management platform will have a UI that’s easy to use, with customizable reporting options and unified dashboards that provide a simple snapshot of overall business operations at a glance. If the UI isn’t intuitive for the user, adoption rates amongst your team will be low.

**Advanced Task Management:** The ability to automate certain tasks like workflow notifications and status updates is where a large part of the time-savings comes into play. This can happen via email notifications or app alerts, which are automatically triggered when a blocker task is completed or a project milestone or phase is reached.

**Resource Management:** Tracking your talent’s workload and availability is key to maximizing the output of your team. Not to mention, big picture vision into physical equipment, meeting rooms and freelance availability makes running an efficient office way easier. Resource management is [one of the most critical aspects](http://spiresearch.com/downloads/whitepapers/evaluating-psa-white-paper.pdf) of a PSA solution because it can improve billable utilization by 5 to 10%.

Additional features to look for in the UI of a PSA your vetting out include time-tracking, help-desk ticketing, data mining and risk analysis tools.

### The Importance of Design and Customizability

At the end of the day, if your clothes don’t fit, they’re not going to look that good on you, no matter how stylish they may be. By the same token, if a PSA’s UI is not designed with the user’s needs at first priority, it’s not going to do much to improve your business operations.

If the UI doesn’t allow for flexibility and customization in management dashboards, your team won’t find benefit in taking the time to run ops from it so they won’t use it.

In an increasingly mobile business world, it’s crucial for the project management platform you choose to allow for remote, real-time access from a variety of devices. If the platform doesn’t accommodate [connection and communication from anywhere](http://spiresearch.com/downloads/whitepapers/evaluating-psa-white-paper.pdf) (and from any device) then it’s not going to be a long-term solution worth investing in.

### The Bottom Line

A good-fitting, timeless pair of jeans can go with any outfit ([skinny jeans are out btw](http://mashable.com/2015/10/28/skinny-jeans-dead/)). And the right PSA with a well thought out UI can offer you and your team deeper insight into how you’re currently operating, and more importantly, how you can improve operations going forward. And what business doesn’t want that kind of insight?
