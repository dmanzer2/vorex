Telecom is one of the most robust, diverse and essential industries in the world. In 2014, [it generated more than $9 billion in revenue](http://www.inc.com/ss/will-yakowicz/10-best-industries-on-2014-inc-5000.html) in the United States alone.

But it’s the ways in which telecom’s services, hardware and software have affected everything from [healthcare](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/health_systems_and_services/healthcares_digital_future) to [home automation](http://www.csimagazine.com/whitepapers/ArthurDLittle/130119-ADL_Smart%20Home_article.pdf) that reveal its ever-expanding importance. Now, telecom is an indispensable ingredient in just about every aspect of our lives.


As recently as 25-30 years ago, telecom meant one thing: telephone services. With the proliferation of the Internet, however, that basic assumption has forever changed. Today, telecom involves a complex array of communication processes and mediums: cell phones, satellites, radio, WiFi, television, fiber optics and myriad other communication paths.

All of this adds up to today’s [increasingly complex telecom landscape](http://www.telecomramblings.com/2015/03/complex-ecosystems-rules-to-survive/). This complexity makes keeping a competitive edge a struggle for even the most forward-thinking telecom companies.

But struggle doesn’t have to be the last word. Here are three best practices to find success in telecom.

**A Focused Future**

Yes, you and your company are providing products and services in the here and now. However, if your leadership [team isn’t focused](http://www.vorex.com/3-ways-to-keep-your-team-focused-and-organized-at-work/) on the ways in which you’ll need to expand and evolve those products and services to meet future needs, your organization’s lifespan will likely be limited.

Because the means of communication between countless devices, people, organizations and [things](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/) is constantly changing, telecom companies are always jockeying for position.

Keep yourself in the race by maintaining an ongoing focus on what your customers will want and need in the future with a [business management platform](http://www.vorex.com/industries/telecommunications/) that’s intuitive and easy for your team to adopt so that they can:

* Keep projects on-time and on- or under-budget
* Know [where to add and cut staff](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/)
* More effectively manage workflow
* More effectively allocate resources
* More effectively manage vendors and suppliers

**Increased Insight and Efficiency**

To best keep up with the competition, a telecom company must also commit to increased efficiency. Efficiency, however, can only be tackled with extensive insight.

Because the work in telecom is so complex and fast-paced, it’s not uncommon for managers to be unaware of:

* Where current projects stand
* Which types of projects yield the highest profit margins
* Which employees are the most productive
* Which critical inventory parts are running low

And without that insight, efficiency will remain out of reach.

Margins are tight in the telecommunications industry. Without an adequate business management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tool, company owners are often left wondering how changes in staffing, vendor prices and project timelines can affect the future of the company.

A cloud-based business management and enterprise platform [designed to specifically meet telecom industry requirements](http://www.vorex.com/industries/telecommunications/) will assist with:

* Vendor and Supplier Management
* Procurement
* Inventory Management
* Invoicing and Billing
* Service Desk and Ticketing
* Demand Planning

**Exceptional Customer Service**

Another way in which telecom companies can differentiate their organization from their competitors is via customer service. [Customer expectations are higher than ever](http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Companies-Keep-Up-with-Soaring-Customer-Expectations/1012615), and communication between customers and your service team must be prompt and accessible on all platforms — from Twitter and email to phone and live chat.
