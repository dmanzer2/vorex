With the [rise of streaming media sources](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2013/03/19/households-abandoning-cable-and-satellite-for-streaming/) and the move away from traditional cable and phone providers, the telecom industry is seeing [more competition for fewer customers](http://www.vorex.com/business-management-and-erp-address-telecoms-top-trends-of-2015/). This puts a higher premium on having the right systems in place to successfully achieve and manage growth.

These consolidation trends seen across the growing-more-competitive-by-the-day telecom industry have made successful project management (PM) vital. Below is a guide to the top three reasons why *every* telecom company should be using a project management system to gain a competitive advantage.

**They Free Up Time and Resources**

As businesses try to scale up their operations and growth, [time and resource management becomes more important](http://www.vorex.com/agency-challenges-scaling-project-management/). Most companies want to allocate as many resources as possible  [to customer service and project operations](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-keys-to-resource-allocation/)–not worried about making sure expense reports and billable hours are documented.

Implementing a PM solution streamlines and automates this process, freeing the company to [focus on strategically moving the business forward.](http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-launches-erp-and-business-management-solution-for-telecom-companies-improving-operations-and-efficiency-on-one-single-platform/) Considering the rapid shifts and tight deadlines of the telecom industry, the ability to [automate tracking time and expenses](http://cewilsonconsulting.com/7-smart-tips-effective-time-tracking/) is more than just good business; it’s invaluable.

**They Support Collaboration and Communication**

Research has shown that nearly 57% of projects fail because of a [“breakdown in communication”](http://www.it-cortex.com/Stat_Failure_Cause.htm) between team members. According to a [2014 About.com survey](http://axerosolutions.com/articles/employee-engagement/139/communicate), lack of direction from management (reported by 38% of those polled), poor communication overall (14%) and constant change that’s not well communicated (12%) topped the reasons employees were dissatisfied with their jobs.

On expansive telecom projects, different departments or employees could find themselves insulated away from other departments. These “silos” can become fixated on their own personal objectives, often at the expense of the big picture.

Telecom projects in particular involve tight deadlines, a diversity of unique tasks and specific protocols that need to be followed closely. Through effective PM, telecom organizations can prevent silos and team members can communicate and share data with ease–from anywhere they happen to be working. It will also monitor unanswered queries and missing data, eliminating [many of the common causes of communication failure](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7954-business-communication-failures.html).

**You Can’t Afford Not To Have One**

According to research by PricewaterhouseCoopers[, only 2.5% of companies complete 100% of their projects](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/152429/cost-bad-project-management.aspx); the larger a project is, [the more likely it is to fail.](http://www.unanet.com/content/project-success-rates-%E2%80%93-progress-over-time-maturity-and-tools-matter)  And as telecom companies have to fight harder and harder for every customer, failure is no longer an option.

Through the use of [online PM solutions](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) to [support the entire lifecycle of the telecom industry](http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-launches-erp-and-business-management-solution-for-telecom-companies-improving-operations-and-efficiency-on-one-single-platform/), companies can more effectively allocate resources, encourage communication and collaboration and protect against project failure.

The competitive edge provided by a PM solution could be the difference between a company thriving and being left in the dust as the industry continues to change.
