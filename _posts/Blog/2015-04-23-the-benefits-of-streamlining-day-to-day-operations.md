A well-run restaurant provides an excellent model of efficiency for day-to-day operations. Have you ever considered how busy restaurants are able to combine hundreds of individual ingredients into a variety of finished dishes while meeting tight deadlines throughout a single meal service?<!--more-->

The secret lies in a culinary arts technique known as _mise en place,_ a system of standardized organization and preparation that drives the entire process. Kitchens are highly regimented work spaces where responsibilities and skills are divided among the smallest possible number of employees necessary to operate the system.

Here are four lessons from the _mise en place_ technique that can be applied to any business organization to improve productivity and efficiency:

  1. **Define Goals and Processes**

Clear communication from leaders can make the difference between a project that drags on and one that finishes quickly. When goals are well-defined and include discrete components, it helps team members plan effectively and recognize when the job is done correctly.

Establishing uniform processes to complete day-to-day tasks enables employees to develop greater efficiency in those tasks over time. Head chefs often prepare model dishes for their staffs before service begins to demonstrate how the finished product should be prepared and what it should look like when it&#8217;s complete. By establishing ahead of time what constitutes a completed task and how the work should be done, employees don&#8217;t have to waste time reinventing the wheel.

  <li>
    <b> Conduct Fewer Meetings</b>
  </li>
</ol>

In a professional kitchen, meetings are run with military precision to ensure they don&#8217;t encroach on the time needed to complete other tasks. When planning meetings, think critically about who is attending each meeting you schedule, and try to schedule meetings at the same times every week so that employees can plan in advance for the break in the day and avoid getting caught mid-task.

Using a business management platform allows for easy visual models that communicate data quickly and efficiently to meeting participants, cutting down on time spent poring over spreadsheets. Establish firm end times for meetings, and make sure to assign DRI (directly responsible individual) roles to ensure that ownership of action items and other tasks that result from meetings are completed.

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <b> Make Lists</b>
  </li>
</ol>

There is no simpler step you can take to streamline operations and save time in the long run than encouraging employees to make lists, revise them as needed and stick to them. The most successful chefs make lists every day, rewriting them over and over again until they are committed to memory.

Organize your lists based on the relative importance of projects, but also take into account what time and resources they will require to be completed. Use project management tools like those built in to Vorex&#8217;s business management platform to organize your time efficiently. When you know exactly what it takes to complete a task, you can plan your days better at the outset. Over time, complex tasks that required planning will become second nature, freeing up that time to grow and develop the business.

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <b> Automate Processes</b>
  </li>
</ol>

Chefs carefully prepare their work spaces so that every ingredient and tool is always in the same location, allowing them to complete repetitive tasks correctly with minimal effort; _mise en place_ literally means &#8220;set in place.&#8221;

You can apply this same standardization to your day-to-day activities. By using a business management platform it becomes easy to automate daily tasks throughout your business, improving efficiency instantly.

The initial time spent automating processes like billing, project management and customer relationship management (CRM) is remarkably small compared with the time savings it offers to busy, growing organizations. Every repetitive task that is taken off of someone&#8217;s plate thanks to a business management platform frees up time and resources that can be used to innovate and develop new business.

By applying some of the _mise en place_ principles to your workplace, you can reduce the time and energy spent managing day-to-day tasks and refocus those resources on growth.
