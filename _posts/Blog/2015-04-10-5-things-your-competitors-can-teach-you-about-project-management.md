When managing your company projects, there are several factors you have to balance to achieve success &#8211; overvaluing any single aspect can throw your entire team askew. Your best competitors embrace the discipline of balance. Asking yourself, &#8220;What&#8217;s their secret?&#8221; can lead to methods and techniques you can learn from your competitors to make your company projects more successful.<!--more-->

  1. **Unified Information**

One trait your most successful competitors embody is unified project information. A company using out-of-date practices or older project management software can find its project data fragmented. Thus the project manager is left dealing with inaccurate, piecemeal information, making it a lot harder to accurately and successfully execute. If you want to keep pace with the market, you need <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/" target="_blank">a unified approach to market data collection and sharing said information</a>.

  <li>
    <strong> Cloud Computing</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

The best companies are the ones thinking ahead. Cloud computing has become the latest trend in business technology. With cloud-based platforms, business information is stored online and can be accessed by end users via desktops, laptops, even smartphones when they need it. This not only keeps everyone on the same platform, it also lets them unify and share project information from any location.

  <li>
    <strong> Real-Time Information Updates</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Business moves fast. When a new product launches, you need to deliver and receive market information that is accurate and up-to-date. A unified project management software application ensures that important market information and sales trends are reported company-wide and from all corners of the world where you have agents or offices.

  <li>
    <strong> An Organized Approach</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Many projects fail before they even begin. As noted in a <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/delivering_large-scale_it_projects_on_time_on_budget_and_on_value" target="_blank">study</a> by McKinsey & Company in conjunction with the University of Oxford, &#8220;17% of IT projects go so bad that they can threaten the very existence of the company. These unpredictable high-impact events&#8211;&#8216;black swans&#8217; in popular risk parlance&#8211;occur significantly more often than would be expected [&#8230;].&#8221; Your successful competitors are taking the necessary steps to mitigate the risk of this happening. The root causes of such catastrophic errors often occur due to under-planning or presenting a project work plan lacking in details and concrete figures. Project management software can supply the data you need to make a project plan based off of exact market data, so your project has a better chance of succeeding.

Project management software also increases transparency and makes it easier to catch errors early on in a project. When information is published where all project members can see it, feedback is easier to give and receive.

  <li>
    <strong> Correct Allocation Of Company Resources</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

One last thing you can learn from your competitors is correct allocation of company resources. As noted a <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/avoid-these-common-causes-for-project-failure/" target="_blank">Techrepublic</a> article, &#8220;This covers a lot of areas. You may not have the right level of resources because you didn&#8217;t estimate the work correctly.&#8221; This is why a coherent plan is essential. By planning out the project process in detail, you can correctly allocate the needed resources and avoid waste and inefficiency. Note that resources does not just mean money; it also covers company equipment and personnel.

The success of a project often hinges on information organization. Modern business management software can help you organize your company projects and keep mission-critical information front and center. By embracing the above techniques and combining them with a trusted, robust project management solution, the success of your competitors will no longer be so mysterious, and you can start seeing the same success in your own project management.
