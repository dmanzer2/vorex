Many agency owners operate in a project-based environment, which brings with it certain challenges for every part of their business, including hiring.

Project-based work is not only difficult to forecast, it also makes the agency owner focus on the “now,” constricting strategic thinking and planning and replacing it with tactical, day-to-day execution.<!--more-->

Project-based agencies also remain beholden to the natural ebb and flow of overall revenue and profitability, as it fluctuates significantly from month-to-month.

The bottom line: this makes it extremely difficult for an agency owner to know when to hire. However, using analytics can help you determine whether your gut instincts are on track — or out of whack.

**Using Longer-term Rolling Averages**

While it’s difficult to make hiring decisions based on the performance of any single month, agency owners can feel more comfortable making personnel decisions around a longer-term rolling average.

“For the project-based areas of our business, hiring decisions are made based on a three-month rolling average revenue,” says Nick Vena, managing partner of Salted Stone, a digital agency out of Southern California. “We believe that this strikes the right balance between protecting our margins and ensuring we can appropriately service our accounts.”

Intelligent hiring decisions can’t be made without an understanding of the complete financial landscape. For the majority of agencies, payroll is the greatest operational cost. Generally speaking – assuming ordinary business and sameness in personnel – it will remain a relatively fixed percentage of overall agency expenses.

**Calculating the Impact of a Hiring Decision**

Given that this is the case, it’s a straightforward task for the agency owner to calculate the impact of potential hiring decisions on overall margin.

For the example below, Andrew the Agency Owner is considering adding a team member that will increase his total monthly payroll liability to $75,000. Based on his average monthly expenses, Andrew knows that this would represent about 82% of his total monthly costs.

Andrew leverages this model to help assess the impact of the potential hire on his overall margin. He understands that the agency would need to bill close to $115,000 per month in order to achieve a 20% margin, which is his target. When he averages out his previous three-month rolling average revenue, he calculates that his agency is billing closer to $100,000 per month.

So he has a decision to make: does he sacrifice margin for a period of time in order to make a hire that will help him scale his business, or would the hire negatively impact his overall profitability to a degree that he is not comfortable with?

Regardless of the decision that Andrew makes, the model has provided him with the information to make a clear and informed decision. The slow periods negatively impact margin, and the agency is often overstaffed relative to its workload, and the busy periods negatively impact customer experience and service quality, as the agency is often understaffed to adequately service its clients’ needs

Implementing a business management solution to help you analyze the profitability of your day-to-day operations will ensure that no hour, or dollar, gets left behind.
