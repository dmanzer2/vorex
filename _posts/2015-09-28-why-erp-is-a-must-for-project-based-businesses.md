When Boston finally finished its now legendary traffic rerouting project, [the Big Dig](https://www.massdot.state.ma.us/highway/TheBigDig/FactsFigures.aspx), it came NINE years after its deadline and cost millions more than its original estimate.

President Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, was riddled with massive technological problems before and after its rollout. A [VA Hospital](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/09/413178870/the-unfinished-va-hospital-thats-more-than-1-billion-over-budget) under construction in Denver is $1 billion over budget, and *it still isn’t finished.*

What do these all have in common? Their project management could have used some tweaking at the most a better solution at the least.

**It’s Complicated**

Project management, it seems, is a complicated affair regardless of the project. If you run a project-based business, you know this reality firsthand. In fact, these stories and those like them probably form the foundation of most of your nightmares.

Success requires the daily management of multiple project fires filled with multiple project irons. And because there’s no such thing as a one-size-fits-all template, each project requires customization. Differences in scope and kind demand flexibility and a knowledge depth that can be hard to come by.

Then there’s the work. How do you stay active enough in your project managers’ circles to ensure you and they know [whether or not the work is on track](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-dirty-little-secret-of-pro)? How do you stay ahead of budget troubles and procurement? What about managing relationships with clients and vendors?

“Complicated” is an understatement. On a daily basis, you risk missing the forest for the trees and vice versa. Help, however, is on the way. [Enterprise resource planning](http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=145731), or ERP, has everything you need to know, manage, plan and execute the projects you’re in charge of–right now.

**How ERP Works**

The main appeal of ERP lies in its ability to give you an integrated view into the heart of your business and all its machinations–in real-time. Especially when combined with a hearty project management platform, you can gain visual knowledge into everything that’s afoot.

From the macro-perspective of your business as a whole to the micro-perspective that is each individual project, ERP lets you see and know about orders, payroll, productivity, fulfillment–even [ticketing and service desk issues](http://www.vorex.com/product/help-desk-and-ticketing/).

When all that data is housed in one platform, streamlining can become more than a pipe dream. Whether you’re a [telecom company](http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2015/08/the-fcc-is-paying-9-billion-to-these-10-telecom-firms.html/) or a healthcare services and supplies provider, here are just some of the ways an ERP can transform your daily operations.

**More Powerful Procurement**

Stop guessing about what you need and when. Eliminate any guesswork about purchasing across projects with a platform that tracks what you’re using in such a way as to offer suggestions regarding inventory needs, quantities, vendors, costs and more. With a robust ERP, you can make better and more lucrative purchasing decisions on time.

**Focused Fulfillment**

With an ERP, you can enjoy the benefits of [automated fulfillment](http://www.vorex.com/industries/telecommunications/). From detailed warehouse intake and outtake records to in-depth, real-time awareness regarding inventory, fulfillment can be fully demystified.

**Better Demand Planning**

Never run out of product and supplies again. Determine your baselines for optimal, low and maximum inventory. Then, let the ERP enact the purchasing processes on your behalf.

**Project-based businesses have a lot on their plates. With a good ERP, you can load those plates up with cake, and eat it, too.
