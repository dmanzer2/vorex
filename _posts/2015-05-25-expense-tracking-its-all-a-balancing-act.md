Everyone knows that careful expense tracking is the key to better understanding and managing your business&#8211;even [Oprah](http://www.oprah.com/money/Track-Your-Spending) is getting in on the action. There are a lot of different systems out there for keeping spending records organized, from old-fashioned pen and paper to smartphone apps and software platforms.<!--more-->

In 1494, Luca Pacioli formally introduced the modern system of double-entry bookkeeping in his seminal book [_Summa di Arithmetica_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summa_de_arithmetica). Known as the godfather of modern accounting, Pacioli took great pains to explain the importance of knowing both your credits and debits in order to effectively manage your finances.

These systems had already been in place for centuries, but Pacioli&#8217;s book became the source of most accounting and financial knowledge in western Europe for many years.

So we can all agree that it&#8217;s essential to keep an eye on spending, but how do you know which system is best for your business? Let&#8217;s run through a few of the items to think through when you&#8217;re trying to make the decision.

  1.  **Balancing Act**

The first and most obvious reason to track your expenses is to determine if you&#8217;re actually making money! Gross revenue can be thrilling to look at on a balance sheet, but without an accurate accounting for expenses, that sheet won&#8217;t give you the full picture of what you&#8217;re actually making in profit.

In order to understand your costs, you need to keep track of your expenses. [Not all costs are expenses](http://www.accountingcoach.com/blog/cost-expense), but many are, and they represent a big piece of the puzzle.

Tracking and understanding your expenses offers insight into the efficiency of different parts of your business. If product A&#8217;s expenses represent a higher percentage of its net value than product B&#8217;s, you might be well served to grow sales of product A, or try and improve the margins of product B. Without expense tracking, you&#8217;d be in the dark when it comes to determining your best course of action.

Planning ahead is one of the keys to managing the growth of your business. Anticipating your needs enables you to secure the resources you&#8217;ll need to continue to thrive. Monitoring trends in your expenses is absolutely necessary for predicting how you&#8217;ll have to adapt to a changing situation.

According to [Pex Card&#8217;s 2014 Benchmark Expense Survey](http://www.pexcard.com/pdf/PEX%20Card%20SMB%20Benchmark%20Expense%20Survey%202014.pdf), 60% of all businesses expected spending to increase in 2014, including an average 26% increase in payroll spending.

If additional staff is the key to your growth, you&#8217;ll have to take their compensation into account. Calculating how much of a payroll increase your business can support relies on careful expense tracking.

Spending money is an unavoidable part of running virtually every business. While we can&#8217;t avoid spending money, what we _can_ do is make sure we&#8217;re spending it as effectively and efficiently as possible.

The secret to spending smart is careful analysis of expense reporting to know where it&#8217;s possible to trim spending and the areas in which you may want to invest more capital. We&#8217;ve [written before](http://www.vorex.com/growth-versus-maintenance/) about how important it is to manage your projects carefully.
