### Service Ticketing: The Key to Customer Sentiment

In the age of Yelp and Twitter, stellar <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/help-desk-and-ticketing/" target="_blank">service desk and ticketing </a>can be vital to <a href="http://www.vorex.com/4-ways-stellar-service-desk-ticketing-can-grow-your-business/" target="_blank">growing your business</a>. Your service desk interactions are the key to positive customer sentiment: customers are calling for resolutions to problems&#8211;and quick and efficient handling of said problems will ensure they hang up with positive feelings.

### Improved Ticketing Times

With some popular PSA solutions, service ticketing can take as long as 15 minutes&#8211;an eternity to a customer already irritated and looking for a solution. With the average hold time before a customer connects at <a href="http://www.dialogtech.com/blog/call-management/the-56-second-hold-time-bogey-average-customer-wait-times-an-ifbyphone-benchmarking-analysis-part-2" target="_blank">around 56 seconds</a>, the faster you can initiate a ticket, the happier a customer will be. And with the time saved from slow ticketing, technicians can spend more time putting additional details into the ticket instead of leapfrogging over input fields to simply keep the process moving.

### Customized Content

Speaking of additional details: <a href="http://www.vorex.com/effective-psas-7-must-have-features/" target="_blank">quality PSA solutions</a> leave room for personalized data input. Whereas some solutions might be clunky &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; software, consolidated platforms such as Vorex allow for high levels of customization.

Contributing more detailed content to a ticket improves customer service dramatically and enables personalized messaging&#8211;no more jargon-y, automated emails that customers find an unhelpful nuisance.

### A View From Above

Easy-to-read dashboards give technicians and service managers a quick snapshot of where things stand and help managers <a href="http://www.vorex.com/your-shorthand-guide-to-better-resource-allocation/" target="_blank">allocate people and resources to the right projects</a>. They also make it easier to track billable hours and measure how the organization is performing against benchmarks with a <a href="http://www.vorex.com/whats-the-difference-between-project-management-and-psa/" target="_blank">single integrated view </a>of your entire company&#8217;s operations.

### Easy Searching Automated Workflows

A quality PSA offers intuitive searching and updating of open tickets. From a central hub, you&#8217;ll be able to control communication, create tickets, monitor open ticket statuses and pull details from tickets in a clean and simple interface. And while we&#8217;re talking about easy&#8230;

### So Easy, Even a Customer Can Use It!

One of the greatest innovations a PSA solution can offer your business is the ability for customers to act as users. Through checking the status of tickets themselves or self-updating information, empowering your customers and reducing the amount of time required by your help desk providers leads to more efficient operations.

In the <a href="http://www.tecworks.com/" target="_blank">recent case of TEC Works</a>, a managed services provider (MSP) and IT consulting firm with clients in the nonprofit, healthcare, legal and insurance industries, simply demoing Vorex&#8217;s top-of-the-line PSA led to a staggering reduction of calls from clients with inquiries about the status of their tickets&#8211;falling nearly 90 percent during the test period.

&#8220;Clients love the new interface, and we&#8217;re finding that customers use Vorex more frequently to check on the progress of their service tickets than they did with our previous solution,&#8221; says Erick Wilson, CEO of TEC Works. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been in the IT industry for a long time, and no one has a solution that&#8217;s as simple, clean and &#8211; dare I say &#8211; as sexy, as Vorex.&#8221;

**Compared to some of the clunky, overly complex PSA solutions that make it difficult to customize and navigate, Vorex&#8217;s ability to incorporate all operational tasks into one affordable and consolidated platform can seem pretty darn sexy.
