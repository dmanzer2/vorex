Raise your hand if you just love dealing with the monthly invoicing. Yeah, thought so.

Until we get to a world in where we’re paying for everything with life credits and Justin Timberlake is a poor hustler on the run from the authorities (what, didn’t anyone see [that movie?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/)), businesses need to track time, track resources and deal with invoicing.<!--more-->

But before you go reacting to this blog like Schwarzenegger on the surface of Mars without a helmet, we can reassure you that there are ways to keep invoicing and tracking from making your head explode.

### Keep It Simple

Before an invoice even gets sent out, your company needs to be able to track time and resources. There [are many solutions](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/) for doing this, but the key to the best solutions are that they keep things simple.

If your company doesn’t know what’s going on within its walls, how is the customer supposed to react to your invoice? Besides, being able to track and record what’s going on is [in your company’s best interests](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&#038;-Self-Employed/What-kind-of-records-should-I-keep) for a lot of reasons, unless you’re a sketchy cash-only business (like babysitting). Although even that [can get dangerous](https://youtu.be/Sj_WCLmAx7o) sometimes.

### Be Up Front

In the business world, how many times have you heard about a company looking at an invoice and saying, “Wait, that can’t be right!”

The customer calls your company, looking for answers. Maybe the answer is simple, and maybe it isn’t, but that should never be apparent to the customer.

Think of your customers like the dude who got charged [more than $500](http://kdvr.com/2014/11/01/how-to-avoid-getting-burned-by-uber/)for an Uber ride that he thought should have been $80 or $100. It ended up that he was getting charged the right amount based on the pricing of the moment from the ride-sharing company.

Do you think that made him OK with it?

Something makes us think he’s not using Uber again. And if your company makes mistakes with invoicing, customers will react like this guy.

By having the [right billing system](http://www.vorex.com/product/billing-invoicing-tracking/)in place, your company can send out correct, easy-to-understand invoices and make the customer feel much better about settling its bill.

### Put It All Together

Even though it scares some companies as much as a clown at a birthday party, good tracking and invoicing is important for any organization. In fact, companies that try to track time and expenses on their own [make things even worse](http://www.vorex.com/step-away-from-the-spreadsheets-how-diy-business-tracking-is-a-business-fail/) for themselves.

The answer often comes from taking time and invoicing solutions and integrating them with something like QuickBooks, which offers businesses a one-stop place to see both sides of the invoicing equation.

In the end, invoicing doesn’t have to be like John Nash writing on a chalkboard in “A Beautiful Mind.” With the right solutions and some simple organization, the process can be simple and clear to all involved — without the imaginary people telling you what to do.
