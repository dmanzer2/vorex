Raise your hand if you just love dealing with the monthly invoicing. Yeah, thought so.

Until we get to a world in where we&#8217;re paying for everything with life credits and Justin Timberlake is a poor hustler on the run from the authorities (what, didn&#8217;t anyone see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/" target="_blank">that movie?</a>), businesses need to track time, track resources and deal with invoicing.<!--more-->

But before you go reacting to this blog like Schwarzenegger on the surface of Mars without a helmet, we can reassure you that there are ways to keep invoicing and tracking from making your head explode.

### Keep It Simple

Before an invoice even gets sent out, your company needs to be able to track time and resources. There <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/" target="_blank">are many solutions</a> for doing this, but the key to the best solutions are that they keep things simple.

If your company doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going on within its walls, how is the customer supposed to react to your invoice? Besides, being able to track and record what&#8217;s going on is <a href="https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&#038;-Self-Employed/What-kind-of-records-should-I-keep" target="_blank">in your company&#8217;s best interests</a> for a lot of reasons, unless you&#8217;re a sketchy cash-only business (like babysitting). Although even that <a href="https://youtu.be/Sj_WCLmAx7o" target="_blank">can get dangerous</a> sometimes.

### Be Up Front

In the business world, how many times have you heard about a company looking at an invoice and saying, &#8220;Wait, that can&#8217;t be right!&#8221;

The customer calls your company, looking for answers. Maybe the answer is simple, and maybe it isn&#8217;t, but that should never be apparent to the customer.

Think of your customers like the dude who got charged <a href="http://kdvr.com/2014/11/01/how-to-avoid-getting-burned-by-uber/" target="_blank">more than $500 </a>for an Uber ride that he thought should have been $80 or $100. It ended up that he was getting charged the right amount based on the pricing of the moment from the ride-sharing company.

Do you think that made him OK with it?

Something makes us think he&#8217;s not using Uber again. And if your company makes mistakes with invoicing, customers will react like this guy.

By having the <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/billing-invoicing-tracking/" target="_blank">right billing system </a>in place, your company can send out correct, easy-to-understand invoices and make the customer feel much better about settling its bill.

### Put It All Together

Even though it scares some companies as much as a clown at a birthday party, good tracking and invoicing is important for any organization. In fact, companies that try to track time and expenses on their own <a href="http://www.vorex.com/step-away-from-the-spreadsheets-how-diy-business-tracking-is-a-business-fail/" target="_blank">make things even worse</a> for themselves.

The answer often comes from taking time and invoicing solutions and integrating them with something like QuickBooks, which offers businesses a one-stop place to see both sides of the invoicing equation.

In the end, invoicing doesn&#8217;t have to be like John Nash writing on a chalkboard in &#8220;A Beautiful Mind.&#8221; With the right solutions and some simple organization, the process can be simple and clear to all involved &#8212; without the imaginary people telling you what to do.
