You’ve got a meeting coming up at 10am, and last night you got an email from your direct supervisor apologetically informing you that the meeting is also going to have to cover the latest project you’ve helped get off the ground.

The problem is that it took you the entire morning yesterday — combing through [pages and pages of dry spreadsheets](http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2013/02/13/microsofts-excel-might-be-the-most-dangerous-software-on-the-planet/) — to pull together the data you needed just to cover the meeting’s original subject, and you spent the entire afternoon crunching the numbers, picking out the data that best indicates the trends you’re interested in tracking and transforming the results into easy-to-read charts and graphs.

You’ve only got one option — to start pouring over the new projects spreadsheets after dinner, and head into the office early tomorrow to create your reports. There’s nothing else you can do.

Even though your company relies on data-driven insights and meticulously tracks all the relevant info across what seems like a million pages of spreadsheets, when it comes to [the technology of data mining](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-data-mining-but-were-afraid-to-ask/255388/), you’re still panning for gold in the creek while other companies use powerful machinery to dig deep into the mountains.

If only there were a way to simplify and speed up the process so you could spend less time getting all the information together and more time making decisions.

### The Right Tools For the Job

That whole nightmare scenario of long evenings spent digging through flat, eye-numbing spreadsheets to put together a strong report is like trying to build a television set every time you want to watch a sitcom.

With [integrated online project management tools, your powerful data-driven reports practically write themselves](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/). Combined with strong enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, there’s no need to waste hours and energy digging through the muck.

The insights your software delivers based on your data help you skip ahead to the strategizing and decision making that absolutely requires the human touch. Imagine the frustrating scenario from above playing out with a strong set of project management and ERP tools.

As soon as the e-mail from your supervisor shows up in your inbox expanding the topics included in tomorrow’s meeting, you open your laptop, pull up the project in your management software, and take a quick look at the project’s stats.

From a single dashboard, you can easily gain insight into:

who’s doing what and who’s available to take on new work

the most profitable types of projects for the company

where new staff is needed – and where to make cuts

how to easily manage workflows and properly allocate resources

Of course, your online project management software is cloud-based, so [you have access to it from wherever you are](http://www.vorex.com/top-5-ways-cloud-based-project-management-provides-a-competitive-edge/), which makes you even more adaptable. That means you can roll with the punches and stay on top of changing situations — like tomorrow’s new, expanded meeting agenda.

Because all your project information is [laid out visually](https://hbr.org/2013/03/the-value-of-a-good-visual-imm)and updated in real-time, you know everything that’s happening, and which information is going to be most valuable for the meeting tomorrow. Generating [a report that’s built on the data but easy on the eyes](http://www.vorex.com/change-your-business-with-new-vorex-features/) is a snap, and you’re back to watching TV before bed with nothing to do in the morning but make sure you’re ready to present on your project.
