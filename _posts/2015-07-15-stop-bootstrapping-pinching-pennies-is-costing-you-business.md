There’s nothing quite like the pride you get from tackling a project on your own. And the savings of DIY-ing can certainly be alluring to anyone trying to save a few bucks. That being said, it’s important to recognize when investing a bit more money upfront can actually save time and money in the long run.<!--more-->

One area where business owners often neglect to invest resources is in project management software. It may seem like things are running “just fine” without a software to track the tasks associated with each project. But [research shows](http://blog.capterra.com/surprising-project-management-statistics/) that organizations benefit big time from the assistance of a formal project management solution.

So, stop bootstrapping and start looking into ways that making a little extra investment upfront can actually save money down the line.

1. **Use Your Resources Wisely**

In a blog for [*Entrepreneur,* Hightail COO Mike Trigg](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246279) outlines some of the most common reasons projects fail, including not having the right talent on the project team. Keeping track of the talent on your team means assigning the right people to the job and getting it right the first time–saving you time and money.

Vorex’s [employee profiles and resource management tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) enable you to easily see who’s free to take on a new project and what skills and experience they’ll bring to the team. With an at-a-glance review of your staff’s skills and availability, you can make better decisions when it comes to bringing in an outside contractor or hiring new team members too.

1. ** Leave No Man (or Woman) Behindt**

Another common reason projects don’t work out? [The decision maker or key team members are left out of the loop](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/246279). If you oversee several projects at once, it can be difficult to keep up with each one.

inventRight co-founder Stephen Key recommends [fostering a culture of transparency](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237817) in your organization to help projects thrive. With conflicting schedules and remote workers, it can be nearly impossible to get the full team together even once, let alone regularly, to discuss projects.

With a [project management platform](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/), you and your team can check on a job’s status when it fits into your schedules. With updates, notes and project materials all there, you get a clear picture of the job’s progress and what still needs to be done.

1. ** Easily Track Time and Billing**If putting together invoices for your customers takes almost as long as your project, it might be time to look for a better way of tracking hours and sending out bills.

First, make sure you’re accurately tracking employees’ time. A business management platform makes it easier for team members to [accurately log their hours](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/) spent on various projects, ensuring accurate billing.

You also get insights into your resource allocation and the current profitability of the each project, helping you keep each job on budget. Then, use the solution to automatically generate invoices, saving staff time.

1. ** Not All in the Same Place? No Problem****
   <br>**
   <br> If some of your employees are among the nearly [10% of workers](http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324539404578342503214110478) who telecommute at least one day a week, Vorex&#8217;s cloud-based platform will allow your team to more easily stay connected.

There are [numerous benefits](http://technologyadvice.com/project-management/blog/benefits-cloud-based-project-management-software/) to cloud-based project management tools, including minimal implementation cost. Vorex enables your team to stay in touch no matter where they are and from any computer – no need to buy new equipment.

“We’re seeing efficiency gains continue, but we’re also starting to see the emergency of new capabilities,” Steve King, a partner at [Emergent](http://www.emergentresearch.com/), told [*Inc.*](http://www.inc.com/graham-winfrey/why-the-cloud-will-transform-small-business-by-2020.html)

Businesses of all sizes and across industries are using cloud-based business tools to save money and better manage their work. And although a business management solution requires commitment to an upfront investment, the gains in productivity will become apparent almost immediately.

Taking a piecemeal or DIY approach to keeping your business organized may save a few bucks in the moment, but most likely won’t pay off in the long run. The benefits that come with a business management platform won’t come for free at first, but they will deliver a return on investment that drives company growth.
