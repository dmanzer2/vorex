How do they do that? With a robust professional services automation (PSA) platform that integrates with a <a href="http://www.continuum.net/solutions/rmm-software/remote-monitoring-and-management" target="_blank">remote monitoring and management</a> (RMM) tool.

From saving time to increasing efficiency, here are four ways stellar service desk and ticketing can help you grow your business.

### 1. Less Time to Close Tickets

In business, time is money, and the less time spent tending to tickets, the more you&#8217;ll have of both. With a PSA that includes key RMM integrations, you can track, update and close tickets much more quickly than with more traditional PSA solutions.

### 2. Operational Efficiency

Because integration allows tickets to be tended to across platforms, greater operational efficiency and customer satisfaction results. As <a href="http://www.businesstrainingworks.com/training-company/kate-zabriskie" target="_blank">Kate Zabriskie</a> stated, &#8220;The customer&#8217;s perception is your reality.&#8221; Nowhere is this more true than when customer service needs are speedily resolved, so you and your customers can happily move on to more pressing matters.

### 3. Track Billable Hours

Keeping accurate track of billable hours is essential to growing your business, but in the realm of service desk and ticketing, it&#8217;s easy to sometimes lose the forest for the trees. When your PSA streamlines service desk and ticketing details, however, the forest and the trees can remain in focus&#8211;but not because you&#8217;re focused on them.

Tracking hours should be a seamless part of tending to and closing tickets. With [a PSA that keeps track of billable hours](http://www.vorex.com/product/help-desk-and-ticketing/) for you, it is.

### 4. The NOC

Remote monitoring and management is only as good as the people and software behind it. With an RMM solution that includes a [Network Operations Center](http://www.continuum.net/solutions/rmm-software/noc) (NOC), technical and customer support are online and working on your behalf every minute of every day.

An NOC can tend to&#8211;and close&#8211;as many as 90% of your routine tickets. How much could your business grow in the face of such assistance?

Give the people what they want, and grow your business at the same time. With a stellar service desk and ticketing solution, the two are one and the same.
