Being a small business owner is tough work, and yet, small businesses are the backbone of America. In fact, at least [60% of employment opportunities](http://www.sbecouncil.org/about-us/facts-and-data/) in the U.S. come from small businesses. That could be why we have an entire week out of the year dedicated to celebrating them!

Each year the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) pays homage to small business owners across America and the contributions they make in our personal lives as well as our economy. This year, [Small Business Week](https://www.sba.gov/nsbw/nsbw) spreads the positive message of entrepreneurialism with the tagline to “Dream Big, Start Small.”

Although it’s a good piece of advice, it’s one that can often seem unrealistic when you find yourself in the throes of running a small business. When your days are filled with managing the small stuff, you might not have time to focus on the big picture.

But the SBA is right: Dreaming big is a vital component to a thriving business that continuously *moves forward*. Without big dreams – and the tools to help you move toward them – your business will remain stagnant, or worse yet, it could regress.

Don’t take our word for it. Take a look at some of the numbers that reflect an overall trend with small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs):

* According to Bloomberg, [80% of small businesses](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericwagner/2013/09/12/five-reasons-8-out-of-10-businesses-fail/) crash and burn within the first 18 months.
* Only [2% of companies](http://www.census.gov/econ/smallbus.html) ever grow beyond $10M in revenue.
* In 2013, 15% of professional service organizations (PSOs) reported no growth or retraction.

So how can you strike a balance between managing the day-to-day operations of your business while keeping the big picture in mind and moving toward your goals? As an online business management software company that works specifically with, and for, small businesses, we’ve gleaned plenty of experience on just that. And here are three of our top pieces of advice:

**1. Take small steps, but don’t lose sight of the big picture.**

We know there are an infinite amount of things you could be doing every day to move your business forward – and that all of these tasks can seem paralyzing and overwhelming. Try to focus on taking breaking things into manageable chunks of work while, of course, always keeping your goals and the big picture in mind.

**2. Stop wasting time on things that can be automated**

As a business owner, you’re no stranger to getting sucked into the minute details of day-to-day business operations. Stop falling into the trap! Your time as an owner is better spent on strategy, growth and innovation rather than paying the bills and chasing down status updates. [Automate these simple daily tasks](http://www.vorex.com/streamline-day-to-day-operations-work-smarter-not-harder/) and free up a lot of your time. Set up automatic payments to vendors when you can. Use solutions that integrate and sync across all your devices to help ensure data you enter on one is updated on another, which is key for items like your personal and business calendars.

**3. Find an all-in-one, cost-effective business management solution**

Finding a way to automate daily operational tasks is essential, but having tools that are spread across dozens of platforms could actually do more harm than good. Instead, find a platform that combines all your business needs into one consolidated location. The integration and holistic overview you’ll get from an all-in-one [business management platform](http://www.vorex.com/product/) will save you time and provide better insight into your company.

Owning a small business is complicated – there’s no question about that. But there are solutions out there that can help make the life of a small business owner a little less hectic. And when you start optimizing the way you take care of the small stuff, you’ll be surprised at the time you’ll be able to spend dreaming about the big stuff.
