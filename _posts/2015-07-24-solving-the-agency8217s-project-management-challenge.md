Company growth is always a good thing. But it’s inevitably accompanied by growing pains. Scale too rapidly, and your tools and methodologies struggle to grow with you. Likewise, your teams can be buried in projects as you hire new talent to keep up with the growing workload.<!--more-->

Among the growing pains many agencies face as they scale is a project management [challenge](http://www.vorex.com/4-challenges-service-based-businesses-face-when-trying-to-scale/). They’ll reach a point where email and the widely adopted collaboration tools (e.g., Basecamp, Trello, etc.) reveal themselves as inadequate when leveraged at scale.

The [most successful agencies](http://www.top50adagencies.com/) distinguish themselves by responding to these pain points quickly and effectively. Here are just a few of the project management issues that can crop up for agency owners when a growth spurt hits.

**Finding the Right Balance**

At some stage in its growth, an agency will have more concurrent projects operating on tight timelines than it can handle. The agency becomes caught between a rock and a hard place when they continue receiving ad hoc (and often same-day) requests from legacy or retainer clients, while trying to manage labor-intensive projects that require the team’s full attention.

Assigning team members across the various projects and tasks is a balancing act that requires forethought and precision to ensure timeliness.

**Mapping the Blocks Early**

Whenever projects require various combinations of employee skill sets and resources, it’s vital to successfully map out the order in which tasks will be completed.

In [SCRUM](https://www.scrum.org/Resources/What-is-Scrum)–the agile software development methodology–team members and project managers work together to identify “blocks” early on when mapping out an entire project. A block is any impediment that would prevent that person from completing their part in the project.

Being able to identify which parts of a project are contingent on another piece–and where the responsibilities of various team members are tied to the tasks associated with other team members–is key to hitting deliverable deadlines and efficiently allocating resources.

**Platform Overload**

More than maybe anyone else in the workforce, people working at an agency deal with the reality that comes with each client and/or project using a distinct communication tool. This requires that project teams must manage  an often robust (and frankly, overwhelming) communication thread.

Various point persons are charged with streamlining communication and collaborate on files simultaneously. Poor communication is often cited as a [top challenge](http://www.villanovau.com/resources/project-management/top-10-challenges/#.VYHbtudhot8) for those charged with project management because effective communication works to establish clear expectations, which increases team morale and leads to improved work results.

**Barely Orchestrated Chaos**

The combination of all three of these challenges creates a manageability nightmare for [agency owners](http://www.vorex.com/industries/consulting-professional-services/). Emails stack up, issues are left unresolved and quality suffers when details slip through the cracks.

Eventually it gets to a point where attempting to manage projects around checkboxes and to-do lists is about as practical as trying to build a house with a screwdriver and electrical tape. When agency management begins to lose visibility into what’s happening and who is doing what, the operation can start to devolve into barely orchestrated chaos.

Sound familiar?

**Solving For The Agency’s Project Management Challenge**

So you’re at a crossroads: the agency will either move forward, backward or nosedive into the abyss of the [80% of failed small businesses](http://www.vorex.com/the-1-tool-agency-owners-use-to-battle-the-odds/). And all of this is likely dependent on your success in finding a way to tackle the project management challenge.

At this critical juncture where common collaboration tools end up [stagnating](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/7954-business-communication-failures.html)–rather than promoting–growth, the successful agency owner will adopt a suite of tools that fits its lifecycle stage.

At this point, agency owners will want to consider the following when choosing which platform or suite of tools will facilitate and enable continued growth:

**Cohesion**

Leveraging multiple communication channels can fragment knowledge. Agencies and clients will be best served by [aggregating all project communication](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) into a single space.

**Depth**

Projects are more complicated than to-do lists and checkboxes can articulate. They involve a concurrent series of interrelated and interdependent tasks and teams that perform those tasks and are often assigned to multiple concurrent projects. They also involve best practice workflows for each skilled team member who comprises these teams.

Agencies will be best served by a project management tool that is built to handle the complexity of dynamic projects that depend on the work of a team.

**Time**

Projects are intrinsically tied to beginning and end points and typically feature a multitude of tasks connecting the two points together. Time is an invaluable business asset, and maintaining control over a project schedule can be the difference between profit and loss in any given month.

Agencies should find a project management platform that [ties tasks to a time-associated schedule](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/) to ensure that management possesses a universal perspective on the status of projects at any given point in time

As an agency owner, it’s your job is to make sure that everyone on your team is equipped with the tools they need to do their job the best they can; you need to have everything you need to do your job, too.
