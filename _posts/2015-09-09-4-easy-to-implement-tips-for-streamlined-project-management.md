In an agency setting, project management can often feel like a jumble of workflows, documentation, affected parties and missed deadlines.

And without a strategy and an easy-to-use[project management solution](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/), projects can begin to look like the staircases at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry–changing at a moment’s notice with little time to react or adjust, and not always leading to the desired location.

Luckily, there are ways to navigate the project management maze quickly, leading to a win-win for both your agency and your clients. With the right platform in place, proper ownership, documentation, sharing and support can be[streamlined](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/streamline-work-process-improve-work-flow-3929.html) for every project.

**1. Ownership**

Failing to properly define roles and responsibilities is one of the main ways that project management can become cumbersome. But even when a project manager is named, there are usually a hundred different ways in which the process can unravel.

Business management tools provide the agency teams with insight and clear delineation into each person’s role in the project, as well as clear advice on workflow and decision-making. With most agencies working on[multiple projects for multiple clients](http://www.innovatenewalbany.org/business/agency-life-manage-multiple-projects/), the greater the access to big picture views, the more likely the project will stay on course.

**2. Documentation**

Because of the multifaceted nature of marketing and public relations projects, agencies often end up creating one-off processes that vary pretty substantially from project to project. By[ thoroughly and properly documenting](http://dabrianmarketing.com/blog/tips-to-streamline-project-management/) those processes, all projects, current and future, can run more efficiently over time.

The key to proper documentation in today’s digital workplace requires a business management solution designed to organize and streamline large volumes of data and client information in a searchable, user friendly way.

**3. Sharing**

When a project goes sour, one of the most frequently cited challenges in the debriefing meetings afterward is a general lack of communication or a lack of information flow in all directions.[It’s ironic that this would be a major cause of inefficiency](http://blog.raventools.com/4-project-management-tips-to-streamline-your-ppc-campaigns/), considering agencies work to communicate effectively on behalf of their clients.

To streamline the project management process, agencies must not only find a business management solution that enables easy, functional document sharing, but the solution must also allow for a truly collaborative experience. This means that documents, feedback and ideation all can be easily accessed within the project structure.

**4. Support**

Despite our best efforts, it’s rare for projects to go off without a hitch. The constant threat of obstacles, goal changes,[scope changes](https://blog.bidsketch.com/clients/preventing-scope-creep/) and more makes it necessary to have a team and a management solution that can adjust to the project while maintaining movement toward the agency’s goals.

For many agency projects, support can come from the IT department, a software vendor, account management teams, creative teams and a slew of other departments working on the project. By understanding and properly planning for the resources and time necessary to complete a project, the entire team will save time and effort in the long run.

With the right team and the right tools, project management does not need to be like those stairs at Hogwarts. With proper preparation, a committed team and a quality[business management solution](http://www.vorex.com/solutions/agencies-professional-services-organizations/), agencies can streamline projects and increase success and bandwidth for future projects.
