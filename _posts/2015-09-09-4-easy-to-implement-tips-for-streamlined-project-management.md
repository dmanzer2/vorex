In an agency setting, project management can often feel like a jumble of workflows, documentation, affected parties and missed deadlines.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And without a strategy and an easy-to-use </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">project management solution</span>](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, projects can begin to look like the staircases at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry&#8211;changing at a moment&#8217;s notice with little time to react or adjust, and not always leading to the desired location.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Luckily, there are ways to navigate the project management maze quickly, leading to a win-win for both your agency and your clients. With the right platform in place, proper ownership, documentation, sharing and support can be </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">streamlined</span>](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/streamline-work-process-improve-work-flow-3929.html) <span style="font-weight: 400;">for every project.</span>

<b style="line-height: 1.6471;">1. Ownership</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Failing to properly define roles and responsibilities is one of the main ways that project management can become cumbersome. But even when a project manager is named, there are usually a hundred different ways in which the process can unravel.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Business management tools provide the agency teams with insight and clear delineation into each person&#8217;s role in the project, as well as clear advice on workflow and decision-making. With most agencies working on </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">multiple projects for multiple clients</span>](http://www.innovatenewalbany.org/business/agency-life-manage-multiple-projects/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, the greater the access to big picture views, the more likely the project will stay on course.</span>

<b style="line-height: 1.6471;">2. Documentation</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Because of the multifaceted nature of marketing and public relations projects, agencies often end up creating one-off processes that vary pretty substantially from project to project. By</span>[ <span style="font-weight: 400;">thoroughly and properly documenting</span>](http://dabrianmarketing.com/blog/tips-to-streamline-project-management/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">those processes, all projects, current and future, can run more efficiently over time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The key to proper documentation in today&#8217;s digital workplace requires a business management solution designed to organize and streamline large volumes of data and client information in a searchable, user friendly way.</span>

**3. Sharing**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When a project goes sour, one of the most frequently cited challenges in the debriefing meetings afterward is a general lack of communication or a lack of information flow in all directions. </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s ironic that this would be a major cause of inefficiency</span>](http://blog.raventools.com/4-project-management-tips-to-streamline-your-ppc-campaigns/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, considering agencies work to communicate effectively on behalf of their clients.</span>

To streamline the project management process, agencies must not only find a business management solution that enables easy, functional document sharing, but the solution must also allow for a truly collaborative experience. This means that documents, feedback and ideation all can be easily accessed within the project structure.

**4. Support**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite our best efforts, it&#8217;s rare for projects to go off without a hitch. The constant threat of obstacles, goal changes, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">scope changes</span>](https://blog.bidsketch.com/clients/preventing-scope-creep/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">and more makes it necessary to have a team and a management solution that can adjust to the project while maintaining movement toward the agency&#8217;s goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many agency projects, support can come from the IT department, a software vendor, account management teams, creative teams and a slew of other departments working on the project. By understanding and properly planning for the resources and time necessary to complete a project, the entire team will save time and effort in the long run.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">With the right team and the right tools, project management does not need to be like those stairs at Hogwarts. With proper preparation, a committed team and a quality </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">business management solution</span>](http://www.vorex.com/solutions/agencies-professional-services-organizations/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, agencies can streamline projects and increase success and bandwidth for future projects.</span>
