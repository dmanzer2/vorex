It&#8217;s a brave new DIY world out there, where you can do anything from knitting a festive scarf to [building a backyard roller coaster](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2014/11/how-to/how-to-build-a-backyard-roller-coaster) with a quick Google search and an easy list of instructions.

Entrepreneurs and small businesses seem to naturally take this self-starter attitude to heart, with business owners and employees often wearing several hats and picking up new skills as their companies grow.<!--more-->

So it makes sense that when approaching business tracking, many companies choose to take advantage of readily available tools like Google Apps or Microsoft Office to hack project management, time tracking and accounting solutions.

However, while using spreadsheets to track project information might _seem_ like an obvious choice to save on overhead costs, this DIY approach can actually _hurt_ your business in the long run.

Here are the five most substantial reasons that all those painstakingly maintained tracking sheets are actually dragging your team down:

**They Eat Up Too Much Time**

How many hours have you sunk into meticulously setting up detailed spreadsheets to track important project information? Then, how much time are you spending training your team on the system you created? And keeping the sheets continuously maintained? Not to mention the need to cross-reference and process the data to create useful reports.

Every minute spent tweaking and updating one of these sheets is time that you aren&#8217;t able to work on the more important parts of your business. Keep in mind that [too much process can kill productivity](http://www.fastcompany.com/1837301/5-ways-process-killing-your-productivity).

Professionally built business tracking software is already set up to organize your data in a useful way and can even do things like [automate invoicing](http://www.vorex.com/product/billing-invoicing-tracking/), saving you time and keeping your business running smoothly.

**They Are Incredibly Disorganized**

According to Forbes.com, &#8220;[the average enterprise using Google Apps has over 250,000 Docs/Sites on their domain](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2012/06/01/google-apps-by-the-numbers/).&#8221; When teams are left to their own devices to create business tracking processes, more often than not, there are overlapping and conflicting documents that make cross-departmental comparisons almost impossible.

The average business owner or project manager is often drowning in a mess of well-intentioned files that are completely counterproductive. Worst of all, these systems are unsustainable and turn business growth opportunities into a daunting picture of <a href="http://testcollab.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/spreadsheet_comic.gif" target="_blank">increased paperwork and tedium</a>.

Cloud-based [business management solutions](http://www.vorex.com/solutions/) can compile all of your data into useful reports that clarify problem areas and strengthen your bottom line. More organized data will [help avoid underreporting and even increase billable hours](http://www.vorex.com/how-one-company-increased-margins-with-improved-time-tracking-billing/), bringing more revenue to your business.

**They Turn Your Data into Eyesores**

Tweak the row colors and borders all you want, a spreadsheet is never fun to look at. Staring at columns of numbers and data can give anyone a headache, and there are bound to be human errors made along the way. It&#8217;s not Excel&#8217;s fault &#8212; it wasn&#8217;t built to be pretty. The user experience makes it difficult both for your employees to input data and for you to process that information later on.

Business management platforms are built from the ground up to gather and compile data &#8212; so rather than spending your day deciphering spreadsheets, you&#8217;re able to spot trends easily with well-designed reports, charts and graphs.

**You Miss the Big Picture**

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, even if you are able to reliably and consistently collect data using a DIY solution, what are you doing with that data?

Too often, companies compile information about their projects, but employees aren&#8217;t able to translate it into useful insights that identify areas for improvement. Simple office elements like a bad organizational structure can [undermine every area of a business](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/happens-bad-organizational-structure-business-22934.html) and spell disaster in the long term.

When [time and expense tracking](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/) is done right, it should not only gather data on employees&#8217; and project time tracking, but also offer insights into workloads and areas of profitability, whether it&#8217;s organized by team, project or employee.

Ready-made reports dive into big data and help decision makers understand where their company is succeeding and where they might improve.

For many budding companies, quick and dirty solutions are prized for getting things done fast. While DIY business tracking can certainly seem like the fastest and cheapest way to monitor activity and organize projects, this approach can backfire when organization and usability suffer.

A thorough and professional approach to business tracking will improve employee productivity, customer experience, and company profitability in the long term.
