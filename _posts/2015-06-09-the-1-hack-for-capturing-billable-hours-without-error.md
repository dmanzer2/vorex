As a service-based business owner, you rely on accurate hours tracking to either charge your clients directly or maintain a precise picture of how to scope out projects. This is the main reason why staying on top of invoicing clients accurately is vital.

But from sending email reminders out to all team members to submit weekly timesheets and tallying those numbers up, to inputting the final numbers in QuickBooks, it&#8217;s a major time drain.<!--more-->

Not to mention, when there isn&#8217;t a uniform or standardized way to track time, many people rely on pen and paper to track time throughout the day. Or worse, they wait until the end of the day and do their best to guess how long they spent working on different projects.

All of these tactics, unfortunately, result in your company losing out on revenue each and every month. <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/workers-are-bad-at-filling-out-timesheets-and-it-costs-billions-a-day" target="_blank">Hours are miscalculated, under-reported and tracked haphazardly</a>, which leads to &#8220;hours leak&#8221; and you being unable to capture all of your billable hours each month.

**Streamline Time Tracking and Invoicing****

**

Hack your business operations by implementing a business management platform that includes [time and expense tracking and automated invoicing](http://www.vorex.com/product/).

**Accounting For Every Minute**

With many small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) being service-oriented, accurately capturing billable hours is vital to your success. Accounting for every minute at the proper rate and capturing all expenses is critical because <a href="http://blog.hourstimetracking.com/you-could-be-wasting-50000-a-year-by-not-tracking-your-time/" target="_blank">not doing so can cost the company in terms of profits</a>, which eventually affects things like payroll.
