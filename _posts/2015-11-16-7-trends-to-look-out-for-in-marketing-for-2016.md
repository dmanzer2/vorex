Pack up the pumpkins, dust off the holiday decorations, and stick a fork in that bird, it&#8217;s done&#8211;2015, that is. Sure, we still have a few more weeks before we officially wrap up the year, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we can&#8217;t start looking ahead to some of the emerging marketing trends we can expect in 2016.<!--more-->

### 1. Mobile and App Marketing

The greatest marketing tool for companies is most likely [in your pocket right now](http://www.vorex.com/productivity-anywhere-any-time-with-vorexs-new-business-management-mobile-app/).

&#8230;No, not your keys.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2015/04/14/10-top-trends-driving-the-future-of-marketing/" target="_blank">Smartphones, tablets and other wearable technology</a> are all driving marketing innovation. Mobile usage <a href="http://adwords.blogspot.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html" target="_blank">has already overtaken desktop traffic</a>, so businesses need to provide a sleek, easy-to-use mobile experience to stay competitive. And with Google app indexing, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/09/29/the-top-7-online-marketing-trends-that-will-dominate-2016/" target="_blank">the app market is exploding</a> and is projected to overtake even the mobile experience.

### 2. Transparent Engagement

Customers are looking for more engagement from their favorite companies and brands&#8211;and greater transparency as well. This reflects a less passive role for consumers: rather than being marketed _to,_ they seek brands that ask them questions and communicate honestly and openly _with_ them. Consumers are looking for <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3043109/sector-forecasting/25-predictions-for-what-marketing-will-look-like-in-2020" target="_blank">genuine, authentic communication</a>, and when brands deliver on that expectancy, they&#8217;ll convert brand advocates and build sales.

### 3. Video Ad Domination!

While video ads on YouTube and Facebook are nothing new, with Google finally rolling out support for <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/09/25/are-video-ads-coming-to-google-search-results/" target="_blank">in-SERP video advertising</a>, we are looking at a potential explosion of new video ads. The growing <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2015/09/23/ad-blocking-a-primer/" target="_blank">prevalence of ad-blocking software</a> has made ads incredibly rare, meaning that video is emerging as one of the few organic opportunities with which to engage consumers online.

### 4. Personalized Experience and Data-driven Marketing

Everyone likes to feel special and noticed. At the same time, while businesses certainly can aim to treat every customer like a beautiful, unique snowflake, <a href="http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/" target="_blank">data-driven marketing</a> can easily become intrusive marketing if the customer feels like they&#8217;re being sold on something&#8211;rather than having a relationship built and reinforced.

### 5. Social Media

To say we live in a social media world is a vast understatement. The truth is, <a href="http://www.vorex.com/38-tips-for-using-social-media-to-grow-your-business/" target="_blank">social media is everything</a>: it&#8217;s the hub of all communication and commerce, to the point where mentioning a &#8220;social&#8221; strategy makes a business sound painfully square. We don&#8217;t &#8220;go online&#8221; anymore, we are always online.

&#8220;Facebook now makes more money on advertising than most of the major television networks and it&#8217;s showing no signs of letting up.&#8221; says Noah Brier, co-founder of <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3043109/sector-forecasting/25-predictions-for-what-marketing-will-look-like-in-2020" target="_blank">Percolate</a>. &#8220;The fact these are social doesn&#8217;t really matter anymore; they&#8217;re part of the marketing mix and offer brands the sort of reach they only got a few times a year on television. To that end, social will just be folded into the broader marketing discipline.&#8221;

### 6. 3D and Virtual Reality

With the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a>&#8211;the most hyped virtual reality device to date&#8211;set to release in the first quarter of 2016, we could be looking at a massive paradigm shift in the way we absorb media and marketing. 3D technology has <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2014/11/16/why-3d-will-dominate-cinema-in-the-future/" target="_blank">already boosted flagging movie ticket sales,</a> demonstrating that viewers have a hunger for novelty in their technology.

3-D and virtual reality technology is becoming increasingly common and more widely integrated into existing platforms. Marketers cannot afford to ignore its potential.

### 7. Content is Still King

It&#8217;s good to be the king. The need for relevant, engaging content (particularly visual) shows <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2015/11/03/the-top-10-marketing-trends-that-will-define-2016/2/" target="_blank">no sign of flagging</a>. Consumers value storytelling and engagement over a hard sell. Getting customers to engage in direct conversation with businesses will create <a href="http://millennialceo.com/branding/branding-evolution-earning-readership-owned-media/" target="_blank">brand loyalists and advocates</a> willing to organically spread the word and maybe even, create user generated content.

If you are hoping to be the &#8220;next big thing&#8221; (or even the &#8220;next medium-sized thing&#8221;), making sure your [project management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) are up to snuff is essential. With [organized, centralized ERP](http://www.vorex.com/characteristics-of-a-modern-erp/) and data insights, you can focus on keeping up the Joneses&#8211;rather than just chasing paper(trails).
