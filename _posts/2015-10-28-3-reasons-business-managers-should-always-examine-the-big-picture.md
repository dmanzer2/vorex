When it comes to business- and work-related idioms, few of them truly relate to reality. &#8220;Keeping one&#8217;s nose to the grindstone,&#8221; for instance, is commonly understood as undertaking work with great focus. A grindstone, however, has nothing to do with it.

By the same token, &#8220;burning the candle at both ends&#8221; commonly refers to working at all hours. These days, though, leaving the lights on will do just fine, thank you very much.<!--more-->

That being said, keeping one&#8217;s eye on the &#8220;big picture&#8221; has never seemed a more apropos bit of managerial advice. With the rise of online project management, [enterprise resource planning (ERP)](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) and dashboards that enable you to visually track everything your organization is up to, examining the big picture isn&#8217;t just a metaphor; it&#8217;s become a literal necessity.

**

Here are three reasons business managers should always examine the big picture to truly stay on top of the ins and outs of what&#8217;s happening within their organization.**

  1.  **1. Better Project Management**

One reason to always examine the big picture is to [manage projects like you&#8217;re on steroids](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/). For the project manager with multiple irons in the fire&#8211;and is there any other kind?&#8211;this can only be accomplished with real-time visibility into every one of your projects. A simple, visual dashboard can help you better allocate employees, see what is and isn&#8217;t on-time and on-budget, improve forecasting and more.

The truth of the matter is: Projects fall short or fail, but they rarely have to. Especially [when better planning is employed](http://innovationintelligence.com/why-do-projects-fail/) and up-to-the-minute insight is available. It&#8217;s possible to keep your organization&#8217;s train on the rails; you just need the right set of tools. Good project management is about maintaining a visual on what your team is up to&#8211;not after the dust has cleared, but well before any explosion.

    <b> 2. Better Project Choices</b>

According to the [Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/BigBangBoom.pdf), less than one third of all IT and software projects are completed on-time, on-budget and to satisfactory implementation. While there are any number of reasons for this disheartening statistic, one reason is that organizations sometimes take on projects for which they&#8217;re woefully unsuited.

It&#8217;s common knowledge that no two projects&#8211;or clients&#8211;are alike. However, too few managers recognize the importance of these differences. With detailed reporting and visual oversight into project profitability, it&#8217;s actually possible to know which kinds of projects and clients are likely to bring in the most amount of money for your organization&#8211;and which aren&#8217;t.

    <b> 3. Better Resource Allocation</b>

</ol>

It&#8217;s been scientifically proven that [your hardest-working, most competent employees are given more work than your lesser ones](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/being-a-go-getter-is-no-fun/393863/). While that may relieve you of some of the stress of oversight, it doesn&#8217;t make for a very efficiently run organization&#8211;or very happy employees.

With [a business management solution](http://vorex.hs-sites.com/regain-control-of-your-business?__hstc=100746398.28be309cb81b91253b50a556c9ce166d.1444913211526.1445105345732.1445107365619.7&__hssc=100746398.7.1445107365619&__hsfp=3888345527) that includes a visual and centralized dashboard, you can change that dynamic. See which employees have more room in their schedules to take on additional work. Find out who&#8217;s performing well and who isn&#8217;t.

[Allocating resources](http://www.vorex.com/your-shorthand-guide-to-better-resource-allocation/) is easier when the big picture isn&#8217;t an idea, but a reality that can actually be seen. As a business manager, you should always be examining the big picture. With a visual dashboard and detailed reporting, you finally can.
