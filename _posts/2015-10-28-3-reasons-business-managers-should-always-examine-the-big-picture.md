When it comes to business- and work-related idioms, few of them truly relate to reality. “Keeping one’s nose to the grindstone,” for instance, is commonly understood as undertaking work with great focus. A grindstone, however, has nothing to do with it.

By the same token, “burning the candle at both ends” commonly refers to working at all hours. These days, though, leaving the lights on will do just fine, thank you very much.

That being said, keeping one’s eye on the “big picture” has never seemed a more apropos bit of managerial advice. With the rise of online project management, [enterprise resource planning (ERP)](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) and dashboards that enable you to visually track everything your organization is up to, examining the big picture isn’t just a metaphor; it’s become a literal necessity.

\*\*

Here are three reasons business managers should always examine the big picture to truly stay on top of the ins and outs of what’s happening within their organization.\*\*

1. **1. Better Project Management**

One reason to always examine the big picture is to [manage projects like you’re on steroids](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/). For the project manager with multiple irons in the fire–and is there any other kind?–this can only be accomplished with real-time visibility into every one of your projects. A simple, visual dashboard can help you better allocate employees, see what is and isn’t on-time and on-budget, improve forecasting and more.

The truth of the matter is: Projects fall short or fail, but they rarely have to. Especially [when better planning is employed](http://innovationintelligence.com/why-do-projects-fail/) and up-to-the-minute insight is available. It’s possible to keep your organization’s train on the rails; you just need the right set of tools. Good project management is about maintaining a visual on what your team is up to–not after the dust has cleared, but well before any explosion.

1. ** 2. Better Project Choices**

According to the [Standish Group](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/BigBangBoom.pdf), less than one third of all IT and software projects are completed on-time, on-budget and to satisfactory implementation. While there are any number of reasons for this disheartening statistic, one reason is that organizations sometimes take on projects for which they’re woefully unsuited.

It’s common knowledge that no two projects–or clients–are alike. However, too few managers recognize the importance of these differences. With detailed reporting and visual oversight into project profitability, it’s actually possible to know which kinds of projects and clients are likely to bring in the most amount of money for your organization–and which aren’t.

1. ** 3. Better Resource Allocation**

It’s been scientifically proven that [your hardest-working, most competent employees are given more work than your lesser ones](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/05/being-a-go-getter-is-no-fun/393863/). While that may relieve you of some of the stress of oversight, it doesn’t make for a very efficiently run organization–or very happy employees.

With [a business management solution](http://vorex.hs-sites.com/regain-control-of-your-business?__hstc=100746398.28be309cb81b91253b50a556c9ce166d.1444913211526.1445105345732.1445107365619.7&amp;__hssc=100746398.7.1445107365619&amp;__hsfp=3888345527) that includes a visual and centralized dashboard, you can change that dynamic. See which employees have more room in their schedules to take on additional work. Find out who’s performing well and who isn’t.

[Allocating resources](http://www.vorex.com/your-shorthand-guide-to-better-resource-allocation/) is easier when the big picture isn’t an idea, but a reality that can actually be seen. As a business manager, you should always be examining the big picture. With a visual dashboard and detailed reporting, you finally can.
