At Vorex, our development team never sleeps. We&#8217;re continually refining our solution to deliver the absolute best online PSA and project management features to help busy business owners streamline day-to-day operations.

Earlier this week, we released even more functions designed to empower your business. In addition to your [favorite Vorex features](http://www.vorex.com/product/) like invoicing, billing, service desk and ticketing and time tracking, our cloud-based solution now also includes:

  * **Enhanced Native CRM** - New dashboards for better visibility into your clients, opportunities and sales pipeline, plus one-click conversion of opportunities into projects and contracts and a new quotation module that enables you to create and email quotes from within the CRM module. We&#8217;ve also added several new reports for prospects and clients.
  * **Search Employees by Skill &#8211;** Easily find the most qualified employee for a project, saving you time and improving customer service.
  * **New Reports** &#8211; In addition to the CRM Reports, there are new Project Reports for improved project insight and Reimbursements Summary and Detail Reports to help track your employees&#8217; expenses and reimbursements.
  * **Resource Utilization Screen &#8211;** An interactive display that shows your employees&#8217; utilization level over a week, month and year period. Now you don&#8217;t have to guess who is busy and who needs more work.
  * **Improved Expenses Insight within Projects** - Project managers can add Expenses to Projects dashboards, enabling better financial insight for projects. The Financial Tab within the Projects dashboard has also been enhanced, including critical budgeting information such as used/remaining hours, expenses, budgets and billing revenue details.

These are just _some_ of the new features of Vorex&#8217;s latest release that have the power to change your business, your life and your world through simplified PSA and project management. If you&#8217;re logged into Vorex, click on &#8220;About&#8221; to see the full list.

We have lots of exciting developments on the roadmap for later this quarter (can you say multi-currency, Gantt Charts for multiple projects, integrations with RMM tools and backup vendors, among others?). You won&#8217;t want to miss what we have in store!
