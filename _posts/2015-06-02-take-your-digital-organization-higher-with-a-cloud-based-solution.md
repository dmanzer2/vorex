Working in today&#8217;s digital age is changing the way companies store, organize, and transmit information. And while the days of filing cabinets and manila folders are not completely over, keeping your digital workspace organized has never been more important.

Here are three reasons businesses are adopting cloud-based business solutions to keep their digital workspaces in order.<!--more-->

  1.  **Remote Access**

It&#8217;s no surprise that <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-industry-insights/cloud-computing-trends-2014-state-cloud-survey" target="_blank">87% of businesses are using cloud-based solutions</a> to keep all of their business-related files, contacts, documents and expenses stored in one place. It&#8217;s the easiest way for today&#8217;s business teams to stay productive and connected as a larger percentage of the workforce chooses to work remotely.

Whether you&#8217;re on a business trip, meeting with potential clients, working from home or managing a remote team, the remote access benefits that come with cloud-based solutions allow your team to access the office from anywhere in the world.

Forgot to invoice your client before leaving the office? Do it from home. Can&#8217;t remember the last time you followed up with a former client while off-site at a business meeting? Look it up.

Make the switch from sticky notes and handwritten lists to digital versions of those to-do lists and documents so you never lose important information ever again. Not only will this eliminate the need for keeping track of countless pieces of paper, this will ensure that their vital contents are always accessible when you&#8217;re on the go.

Do you feel like you&#8217;re drowning in emails, attachments and digital documents? You&#8217;re not the only one. <a href="http://www.radicati.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Email-Statistics-Report-2014-2018-Executive-Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Radicati reports</a> that 108.7 billion business emails are sent and received every day&#8211;that&#8217;s a lot of information to keep tabs on!

Coworkers can collaborate and communicate digitally in one place with a project management platform.

Tasks, projects and due dates are gathered and easily viewable in one centralized place, replacing the need for personal organization systems, inefficient handwritten notes and frustrating searches through old emails when you&#8217;re looking for a particular email or attachment.
