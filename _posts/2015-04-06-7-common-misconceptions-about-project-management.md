Almost all employees have an opinion about project management, and more often than not, it is an unfavorable view. On its own, project management is not an activity that’s directly tied to revenue, making it easy to form misconceptions about the role of project management, especially when its aims are not clearly communicated to team members.

Let’s take a look at some of the misconceptions surrounding project management. Though our list is long, don’t be discouraged – there’s a solution! One of the best ways to debunk misconceptions like these is to have a [centralized communication system](http://www.vorex.com/) that keeps all team members apprised of project aims and developments.

**Project management is unnecessary overhead**

The time spent on planning a project might appear to be a waste of resources and a significant delay to the more tangible work involved. According to the [Project Management Institute](http://www.corporatecomplianceinsights.com/top-five-project-management-myths/), organizations employing robust project management processes out-perform those that don’t in three major ways:

* On-time delivery is 28% higher
* Within-budget delivery is 24% higher
* Goal achievement is 20% higher

**Project managers are just paper pushers**

Many people involved with a project misunderstand the project manager’s role when visible activities seem only to be comprised of developing project plans, resource schedules, endless status updates, and compiling meeting notes. The real value of a good project manager is in the value he or she adds to meetings and negotiations, being a mentor and counselor, and in being the project champion.

**The process is the most important part of a project**

In an in-depth report on talent management, the Project Management Institute, cited organizations’ [growth and profitability](http://www.pmi.org/learning/pm-network/2014/debunking-common-project-myths.aspx#sthash.nha8UZXs.dpbs) as being directly attributable to the employee talent pool rather than company processes. The report demonstrates that the shortage in available talent has reduced project quality by 31%, inhibited and lessened innovation by 29%, and caused the cancellation of important initiatives by 27% more than a comparable talent-rich period.

**Execution is the top priority**

Racing ahead with the execution of a project is a difficult temptation to resist, but to get high-quality results, speed cannot be the top priority. Project management experts agree that without proper planning, it is more than likely that a project will require significant rework, which in turn causes frustration for the team, missed milestones, and probable overruns in budget and time. Execution without sufficient planning that uncontrollably runs off course like a house fire, very often leads directly to expensive and time-consuming fire-fighting.

**After risk assessment, race to the finish line**

After the initial risk assessment, many projects fail to make risk review part of ongoing meetings and evaluations, but new and unconsidered risks always pop up in the course of a longer project. If project risk is not periodically revisited as a potential factor influencing completion milestones, the chances increase that the unexpected will occur and the entire schedule will be thrown into chaos.

**No project should ever be abandoned**

Once a significant amount of work and resources has been poured into a project, it’s only natural that management and team members are reluctant to pull the plug and scrap the initiative. Doubtless, it will be an embarrassment to company managers and executives, but when the original need for the project has vanished and the project no longer makes sense, further investment is simply unjustifiable.

**Once budgets are locked in, new project ideas must wait until next year**

This is a formula for losing good ideas and having them simply fall off the radar. In companies where managers regularly submit project ideas for the improvement of the business, it might be better to establish a rolling review of these ideas to get visibility for them and ensure that they are not lost before next year’s budget meetings.

Project management matters immensely — it guides the productivity and ultimately, the success of an organization. Consider these myths when approaching your next project.
