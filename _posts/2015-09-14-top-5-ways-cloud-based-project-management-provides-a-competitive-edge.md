Many systems can also be scaled to accommodate the size and unique needs of a company. This means no more &#8220;one-size-fits-all&#8221; solutions packed with features you don&#8217;t really need. Even better, many cloud-based PMs offer a free trial so you can try before they buy.

**Security**

With data security becoming increasingly important, cloud-based PM platforms typically make use of Â [encrypted databases accessed by remote logins](https://www.workzone.com/top-10-little-known-benefits-cloud-based-project-management/).

If a work device happens to be destroyed or stolen, the data will remain secure, and your progress won&#8217;t be lost. Preventing unauthorized access to the data can be as simple as logging in and changing your password.

**Flexibility**

Cloud-based PMs are designed to work across multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux). The team members can use whatever operating system they are most comfortable with, minimizing the need to retrain employees on different systems, which can help boost productivity. PM tools can be updated in real time and on the fly, enabling the team to be more proactive than reactive.

**Increased Productivity**

Above all else, a cloud-based project management solution can help your organization increase its productivity. Set up is generally pretty easy, merely requiring a sign-up on the solution provider&#8217;s website.

Once the cloud-based project management system is in place, your team can work remotely, 24-hours a day on any project. Progress is saved automatically in case your computer crashes or you accidentally spill your cappuccino on your keyboard.

By implementing cloud-based project management solutions, companies can take advantage of the remote access features, security and flexibility, all while saving on setup and IT costs and increasing productivity.
