With the boxes, the achy backs, adjusting to a new environment and the extreme excess bubble wrap, no one ever _really_ likes moving day.

But when it&#8217;s because of 50 percent employee growth and rapid company expansion, moving day gives us cause for a little &#8211; okay, MAJOR &#8211; celebration!

Today, in partnership with the <a href="https://www.dallaschamber.org/" target="_blank">Dallas Regional Chamber</a>, Vorex is hosting a ribbon-cutting to mark the opening of our new company headquarters. With all the change and growth we&#8217;ve experienced during the past few years, our old office was forcing us to get to know one another a bit too well. This upgraded 6,000 square-foot space boasts a modern open floor plan and will serve as Vorex global headquarters to accommodate our rapid growth, boost collaboration and innovation and better support our global customer base.

Vorex is just one of the many exciting high-growth companies in Dallas, an area <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2014/08/04/texas-ranked-fastest-growing-state-for-tech-jobs.html" target="_blank">bursting at the seams with tech jobs</a>, exciting start-up choices and unique opportunities. Our new digs and expanded global vision make working at Vorex the _best_ choice, and here are five reasons why.

  1. **Location, location, location**

Our new office is located in the bustling, trendy <a href="http://www.galleriadallas.com/" target="_blank">North Dallas Galleria</a> area, which is becoming known for success in the high-growth tech industry. The Dallas area has <a href="http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2014/09/new-study-dallas-area-ranks-near-top-for-high-tech-growth.html/" target="_blank">142,000 high-tech jobs</a>, with most of them being located in the North Dallas vicinity. The landscape here is ripe for those seeking employment in the tech or start-up spaces; we couldn&#8217;t be located in a more exciting place!

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    <strong>We&#8217;re paving the way for more growth</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

We currently have 30 employees worldwide and expect that number to double by the end of the year to expand operations. Our business continues to scale at a rapid rate, and moving into this larger space will allow us to physically scale with it and keep up with demand.

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <strong>We make excellent customer service our top priority</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

Our new office has a workspace dedicated solely to better serving our growing customer base by prioritizing areas for support staff. As we onboard more and more new clients, we want to ensure we have the resources in place to support them and make sure they have the best experience possible with Vorex.

  <li>
    <strong>Accelerating to new heights</strong>
  </li>
</ol>

While our business is certainly growing and reaching new altitude, so is our office space. Did we mention yet that our new home occupies the penthouse suite? Being on the twelfth floor isn&#8217;t too shabby and certainly provides pretty great views during client meetings and conference calls!

With support from the Dallas Regional Chamber, we&#8217;re extremely excited to officially be making this space our new headquarters. We know it will better serve our global customer base and allow us to continue to grow. If you&#8217;re in the area, stop by to check out our new digs! We&#8217;d love to have you.
