It’s one of the most important lessons in life, one you probably learned in kindergarten: Play nice with others. And nowhere is this lesson more relevant than when considering a robust professional services automation (PSA) platform designed to streamline your business and operations.

Organizations these days are faced with [needing to do more with less](https://diginomica.com/2015/12/02/why-modern-service-businesses-must-unite-services-sales-and-hr/#.VmiJVt-rSRs), and automation is the key. And while a robust PSA platform on its own can bring [much needed efficiency](http://www.mspbusinessmanagement.com/blog/does-my-msp-need-psa-tool), integrations with other business tools your organization is already using, such as a [remote monitoring and management (RMM)](http://www.continuum.net/solutions/rmm-software/remote-monitoring-and-management) tool like the [Continuum RMM](http://www.vorex.com/navigate-2015-vorex-and-continuum-integrate-for-better-business-workflows-and-customer-service/), can help visualize and manage all aspects of your company’s projects.

### Time Tracking for Busy Businesses

For small- to medium-sized service-based business, every “billable hour” counts. Yet often, valuable time is lost because of simple human error. Firms on average lose about $50,000 per year in revenue simply due to [insufficient email tracking with clients and others](https://hbr.org/2015/01/workers-are-bad-at-filling-out-timesheets-and-it-costs-billions-a-day). That’s right: you could lose more just by not logging hours than you could by wiring money directly to a supposed “[Nigerian Prince](https://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/get-consumer-help/articles/the-nigerian-prince-old-scam-new-twist/)!”

Through [integrated time and expense tracking](http://www.vorex.com/the-1-hack-for-capturing-billable-hours-without-error/) systems built in to your PSA, hours are no longer be miscalculated, underreported or tracked haphazardly. That means no dollars and cents left behind.

### Invoicing Solutions, Not Accounting Problems

With [direct integration into accounting software](http://www.vorex.com/media/new-vorex-winter-2015-release-simplifies-online-project-management-for-smbs-and-professional-services-organizations/) like QuickBooks, every minute of billable time is accounted for. Invoices can automatically be generated and managed, and clients billed directly.

Integration with other commonly-used business software like Outlook and Salesforce means that your employees will not be left scratching their heads or having to be extensively retrained on proprietary systems.

### Existing Systems? Play Nice, You Two

Most importantly, your PSA has to integrate smoothly with existing systems and solutions. A PSA should be able to give you a view-from-above of the full scope of your company and its operations, giving you a leg up when it comes to [enterprise resource planning](http://www.vorex.com/characteristics-of-a-modern-erp/) (ERP) for your projects.

Additionally, the PSA you choose needs to interact with your [customer relationship management (CRM)](http://www.vorex.com/product/customer-relationship-management/) tools. A 2015 Benchmark Report from market researcher [Service Performance Insight (SPI)](http://www.spiresearch.com/psmaturitymodel/2015-best-of-the-best.html) affirms the importance of a reciprocal relationship.

“PSA, integrated with CRM, enables PSOs to better schedule resources and projects to ensure they begin and end on time,” the report reads. “With integrated HCM, human resources, recruiting and resource management all benefit from visibility into in-demand skills, consultant preferences and career aspirations.”

“The integration between Vorex and Continuum works incredibly well and resulted in vast productivity gains,” said [C.J. Ezell](http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-and-continuum-launch-platform-integration-to-streamline-ticketing-and-workflows-for-increased-time-savings-and-productivity/), founder of PointClear Networks, a Vorex and Continuum user. “It’s clean, easy to use and seamlessly handles updating and closing tickets between the platforms.
