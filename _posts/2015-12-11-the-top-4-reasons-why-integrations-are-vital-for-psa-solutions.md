It&#8217;s one of the most important lessons in life, one you probably learned in kindergarten: Play nice with others. And nowhere is this lesson more relevant than when considering a robust professional services automation (PSA) platform designed to streamline your business and operations.<!--more-->

Organizations these days are faced with <a href="https://diginomica.com/2015/12/02/why-modern-service-businesses-must-unite-services-sales-and-hr/#.VmiJVt-rSRs" target="_blank">needing to do more with less</a>, and automation is the key. And while a robust PSA platform on its own can bring <a href="http://www.mspbusinessmanagement.com/blog/does-my-msp-need-psa-tool" target="_blank">much needed efficiency</a>, integrations with other business tools your organization is already using, such as a <a href="http://www.continuum.net/solutions/rmm-software/remote-monitoring-and-management" target="_blank">remote monitoring and management (RMM)</a> tool like the <a href="http://www.vorex.com/navigate-2015-vorex-and-continuum-integrate-for-better-business-workflows-and-customer-service/" target="_blank">Continuum RMM</a>, can help visualize and manage all aspects of your company&#8217;s projects.

### Time Tracking for Busy Businesses

For small- to medium-sized service-based business, every &#8220;billable hour&#8221; counts. Yet often, valuable time is lost because of simple human error. Firms on average lose about $50,000 per year in revenue simply due to <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/workers-are-bad-at-filling-out-timesheets-and-it-costs-billions-a-day" target="_blank">insufficient email tracking with clients and others</a>. That&#8217;s right: you could lose more just by not logging hours than you could by wiring money directly to a supposed &#8220;<a href="https://www.bbb.org/new-york-city/get-consumer-help/articles/the-nigerian-prince-old-scam-new-twist/" target="_blank">Nigerian Prince</a>!&#8221;

Through <a href="http://www.vorex.com/the-1-hack-for-capturing-billable-hours-without-error/" target="_blank">integrated time and expense tracking</a> systems built in to your PSA, hours are no longer be miscalculated, underreported or tracked haphazardly. That means no dollars and cents left behind.

### Invoicing Solutions, Not Accounting Problems

With <a href="http://www.vorex.com/media/new-vorex-winter-2015-release-simplifies-online-project-management-for-smbs-and-professional-services-organizations/" target="_blank">direct integration into accounting software</a> like QuickBooks, every minute of billable time is accounted for. Invoices can automatically be generated and managed, and clients billed directly.

Integration with other commonly-used business software like Outlook and Salesforce means that your employees will not be left scratching their heads or having to be extensively retrained on proprietary systems.

### Existing Systems? Play Nice, You Two

Most importantly, your PSA has to integrate smoothly with existing systems and solutions. A PSA should be able to give you a view-from-above of the full scope of your company and its operations, giving you a leg up when it comes to <a href="http://www.vorex.com/characteristics-of-a-modern-erp/" target="_blank">enterprise resource planning</a> (ERP) for your projects.

Additionally, the PSA you choose needs to interact with your <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/customer-relationship-management/" target="_blank">customer relationship management (CRM)</a> tools. A 2015 Benchmark Report from market researcher <a href="http://www.spiresearch.com/psmaturitymodel/2015-best-of-the-best.html" target="_blank">Service Performance Insight (SPI)</a> affirms the importance of a reciprocal relationship.

&#8220;PSA, integrated with CRM, enables PSOs to better schedule resources and projects to ensure they begin and end on time,&#8221; the report reads. &#8220;With integrated HCM, human resources, recruiting and resource management all benefit from visibility into in-demand skills, consultant preferences and career aspirations.&#8221;
