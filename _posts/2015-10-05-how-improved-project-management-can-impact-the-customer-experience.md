If customer service surveys, anecdotes and data are correct, [customer experience](http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2015/07/02/customer-experience/) (CX) has emerged as the new King of the Business World. According to Lou Carbone, the man who first coined the term *customer experience*, “What branding was to the 20th century, experience management will be to the 21st.”

To any business looking to distance itself from its competitors, then, CX is paramount.<!--more-->

But there is often a disconnect between the experience a company *believes* it’s giving its customers and [the one it is actually providing](https://econsultancy.com/blog/66326-brands-think-they-provide-great-customer-experience-consumers-disagree/). Don’t let customer experience become one more facet of management that’s either off the mark or allowed to slip through the cracks.

**CX as a Relationship**

Customer experience is all about the relationship a customer shares with you and your products over the lifetime of doing–or not doing–business with you. It involves every interaction, no matter how small: advertisements in the subway, calls to representatives, scrolling past social media posts and, of course, purchases.

Given that [91% of surveyed organizations](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/1903222) claim to have a desire to lead in customer experience at the same time that only 37% of them have actually begun an initiative, a question arises: How seriously are you taking this relationship?

Improving your customers’ experiences doesn’t have to be rocket science. Here’s one simple course of action: Improve your [project management](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/).

**What Does Better Project Management Look Like?**

The best project management software provides companies real-time visibility into everything from resource allocation to [help desk ticketing](http://www.vorex.com/product/help-desk-and-ticketing/). After all, the devil–as any business owner or manager knows–is in the details. With a project management solution that lets you literally *see* what’s happening inside of every project, you can keep that devil in line.

With a project management solution, you don’t have to waste time seeking out project managers. Instead, you can easily find out which projects are on-time and on-budget and which aren’t in a centralized, integrated dashboard. Stay ahead of [resource allocation](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) needs and surpluses with insight into employee workloads and productivity.

Learn which projects are most likely to make you money. Predict excess workloads ahead of time, so you can hire the muscle you need to get it done well and done efficiently.

A better [project management solution](http://www.vorex.com/solving-the-agencys-project-management-challenge/) enables you to streamline your workflows, which lets you anticipate conflicts before they arise. You’ll be able to fix problems before your customers ever hear about them. You can automate your help desk and ticketing, so customers feel heard and cared for immediately.

**CX and Project Management: The Tie That Binds**

Customer experience will define your company–for better or worse. With some of your clients and customers, it already does. Better management of your projects makes for happier clients, and real-time visibility is the key to driving that result.

Because there’s really no question that better projects, completed on-time and on-budget, yield happier customers. There’s no question that customer service issues easily reported, identified and solved yield happier customers. There’s no question that aligning an employee’s with a particular job will yield higher quality work.

Better project management is about seeing what you have so you can manage it more effectively. In the end, that effectiveness forms the bread and butter of the customer’s experience.
