It’s a sobering statistic: In the U.S., more than 80 percent of [new businesses fail](http://www.vorex.com/can-business-management-software-prevent-failure/) in the first 18 months. Unfortunately, most of these organizations are small businesses, many of which are focused on providing professional services like marketing, advertising and digital services.

Of the 770,000 professional services organizations (PSOs) in the U.S., 15 percent reported no growth last year, while 10 percent reported a net loss. That’s not good for *anyone’s* business.

[Scaling](http://www.vorex.com/agency-challenges-scaling-project-management/) any professional services organization is difficult, but marketing, advertising and digital agencies face an uphill battle for a number of reasons. Read on to see how agency owners can actually beat the odds and grow–smartly.

**Commoditization**

There are many other organizations competing for the same business–some desperate and some better than you. Even though you’re focused and proven at your craft, in today’s crowded agency world, other agencies are trying to [compete on the only tool they have to win](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/247462/the-commoditization-of-creativity.html): price.

Sure, the old adage “you get what you pay for” still rings true for some, but competition looking to drive down costs devalues what you provide and turns what is a craft into a commodity.

**The Race for Talent**

You, combined with your team, are the collective brain trust that determines everything: on-time delivery, happy clients, award-winning work, progress up the value chain, etc. As a service-based company, you need creative, [smart people](http://www.vorex.com/3-ways-to-keep-your-team-focused-and-organized-at-work/) to differentiate your company.

The challenge is that creative and smart people are hard to come by, payroll is your biggest expense and keeping them in today’s [competitive job market](http://thehiringsite.careerbuilder.com/2015/01/01/careerbuilder-hiring-forecast-2015/) is not an easy task.

**New Business Left on the Table**

Your brand promise might be anchored on growing your clients’ businesses, but most [boutique agencies don’t excel](http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/04/truths-content-marketing-agencies/v) at driving new business their own way. Why? More often than not, business owners are the sole salesperson in their organization, and they are tasked with operational management, sales, strategic growth and overseeing day-to-day project management.

That’s a lot of stuff on your to-do list. So how can agency owners plan and execute their big picture strategy when they’re sucked into minutia day in and day out?

**The Solution: PSA & Project Management Software**

You know you can’t get out of the task management hole alone–you need more people. But, your margins are so tight, how can you afford to pay the best and the brightest?

Here’s a tip: invest in both technology and people, including certified [Project Management Professionals (PMPs)](http://www.pmi.org/Certification/Project-Management-Professional-PMP.aspx). You can do more with fewer people, if (and only if) the tools are in place to support, guide, and lead your team to success.

The complex business management solutions built for large enterprises are too heavy-handed, and we all know there are plenty of inadequate, overly simplistic products targeting small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs). This is exactly why we designed a sophisticated and powerful business management software that [streamlines day-to-day operations](http://www.vorex.com/streamline-day-to-day-operations-work-smarter-not-harder/) and won’t break the bank.

Through an intuitive, feature-rich platform, Vorex offers professional services automation (PSA) and project management software that makes it easy for agency owners to manage, grow and track their businesses in a single web-based application.

This approach enables business owners to focus on the strategy required to move their businesses forward, empowering them to better serve customers, boost productivity, streamline processes and improve profitability.
