When managing your team, one key to success is efficiency. Wasted time and a lack of overall productivity not only cost the company money, but can also slow down projects and cause friction within your team. Here are nine tips to help you successfully track and measure your team’s efficiency.<!--more-->

1. **How Much Work Is Being Completed?**

It’s tempting to look at the hours your team works and conclude things are going well just by the number of hours put toward projects. However, this does not mean time is being used effectively. Measure your team not by time, but by the tasks that are being completed and by their value to your organization.

1. ** Project Timeframe**

This is a no-brainer, but projects should be finished on time. If your team is constantly behind or late, then the efficiency of each individual and the process as a whole should be observed and re-evaluated. The problem could be assigning tasks to under-qualified employees, or it could be a lack of appropriate timeframe allocation for projects.

1. ** Expenses**

One component of efficacy is the overall expense of a project. By tracking your expenses, you can make sure the ROI is paying off, money isn’t going to waste and that projects are not running over balance.

1. ** Use Of Resources**

Another important metric to measure your team’s efficiency is [how they are using resources](http://www.vorex.com/agency-challenges-scaling-project-management/). This includes employees, company time, money, and equipment. If a high amount of company resources is going toward a team, and they are yielding low results, then overall they are not efficient and you might reconsider how you’re allocating and managing them.

1. ** The Bottom Line**

Keep your eye on the bottom line. A lot of management fails by getting wrapped up in micromanagement and losing sight of overall company goals. You can’t manage every piece of data, and you will gain more useful results by tracking data streams that *directly* influence your team and are of utmost importance (i.e. profitability).

1. ** Response To Customers**

Depending on your business, you might have varying degrees of customer interaction. However, reacting to customer questions or concerns can be a good measure of team efficacy. Are concerns being addressed, what are the customers saying, and what are the concerns being raised? If common issues continue to come up, it’s time to dig deeper into your customer-facing messaging and procedures to search for a more impactful process.

1. ** Customer Feedback**

Related to the above, be sure to get feedback from your customers. Make sure customers are pleased with your official responses, and that issues are addressed in a proper timeframe. Avoiding recurrent issues and common complaints is a sign that your work and efforts are yielding positive results. If you receive negative feedback, listen. Use it as a starting point for an investigation into how to improve.

1. ** Read Reports**

Modern business software can provide a wide variety of metrics. One of the best ways to track your team’s efficiency is to run regular reports and compare the ***relevant*** figures. Positive trends can point to effective efficiency practices while negative ones could be signs a change is needed.

1. ** Ask For Updates**

Keep tabs on your team. Set goals for them and ask about progress. You can measure their statements on what tasks they’re completing versus the hard data you have already collected to gauge their true workload and efficiency.

There are a multitude of data points you can use to truly understand your team’s efficiency. [Project management software](http://www.vorex.com/product/) allows you to more easily gather this data. Once implemented, not only do you have a clearer picture, [but as noted in a](http://www.keyedin.com/keyedinprojects/article/5-simple-ways-to-improve-employee-utilization-and-productivity/)[KeyedIn article](http://www.keyedin.com/keyedinprojects/article/5-simple-ways-to-improve-employee-utilization-and-productivity/), “improving your resource deployment upfront should not only improve your future resource productivity and utilization, it will also give you a more realistic view of the health of the organization by comparing planned versus actual.”
