Given that our greatest mission at Vorex is providing the best possible service and product to our customers, you can imagine our excitement at being nominated for [The Sleeter Group&#8217;s Awesome App Award](http://www.sleeter.com/awesomeapps). <!--more-->

The Awesome Application Program &#8220;recognizes the highest quality software solutions available in the SMB accounting software marketplace,&#8221; and as of this morning you can now [cast your votes for Vorex](http://www.sleeter.com/awesomeapps/2016/vorex)!

The Sleeter Group believes that small business success is highly dependent on businesses and owners developing efficient business processes. We couldn&#8217;t agree more, which is why we strive to continually improve our [business management software](http://www.vorex.com/product/) &#8211; because when you win, we win.

Winners for the Awesome App award are selected via a combination of public voting (40% of the total vote) and an expert panel (60%) comprised of a team of technical and marketing experts who will evaluate each product. This panel includes some of the most experienced accounting software experts in the industry, so we know that the judging process is in good hands.

To determine the winners, the panel will evaluate each applicant based on:

  * Public evaluation data
  * How the product integrates with other parts of the accounting and business process system
  * Marketing reputation of the product
  * How the product implements &#8220;best practices&#8221; for integration with QuickBooks and other software solutions.

We think our robust integrations and excellent reputation among customers make us a perfect candidate for the Awesome App category. **Head over to the [voting page](http://www.sleeter.com/awesomeapps/2016/vorex) this next week and give us your vote of confidence!**
