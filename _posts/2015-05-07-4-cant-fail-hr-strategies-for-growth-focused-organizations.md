With today’s project management platforms, HR teams can keep tabs on their hiring pipeline, candidate notes during the interview process, and current team members’ productivity levels — all vital to-do’s for today’s growth-focused organizations.<!--more-->

While every business is different, a few human resources (HR) principles remain constant: hire great talent, keep employees motivated, always be recruiting and give the smart people you hire the chance to show you why you hired them in the first place!

Forward-thinking HR leaders can keep these four tips in mind and invest their efforts in strategies that pay off big time!

**1. Find great talent**

When organizations are busy, it’s easy for leaders to feel pressure to hire to fill a short-term need rather than to fulfill a long-term strategy. But hiring the wrong employee can present a danger to the longevity of an organization.

While a candidate can stand out on paper, his or her actual talent can’t be accurately measured until they are operating within an organization. This is why it’s important to hire based on a comprehensive set of markers, rather than just a resume.

Recruiters and hiring managers should have a complete understanding of the overall vision of their organization and how a certain candidate might fit into that vision.

While hiring based on expertise is useful to a degree, that alone is not the best indicator of success. It’s easy for a leader to make the mistake of hiring an expert and then allow them to work strictly within his or her realm of knowledge. But doing so limits an employee’s ability to grow within the organization, and it also limits their ability to positively influence other departments.

Growing organizations should focus on hiring a talent who is willing to grow with the company and who fits the organization’s personality. In times of need, businesses with cross-trained employees will prove to be more agile.

**2. Track projects for staff forecasting**

When a service-based business grows, leaders will inevitably ask whether “clients or staff come first?” If a leader chooses to take on additional workload without hiring new staff, the quality of work delivered to the client will likely suffer. On the other hand, labor is the primary expense a service-based business takes on.

So to grow effectively, a business owner must decide when they should hire a new employee to maximize the quality of work produced while still maintaining high margins. The best way to avoid an over- or under-estimation in staffing is to accurately track the time it takes to complete each aspect of a project.

[Project management software typically includes time and expense tracking tools](http://www.vorex.com/growth-versus-maintenance/) and can aid HR teams caught in the midst of forecasting when to hire new talent.

**3. Stop micromanaging**

As an agency grows, department leads will have less direct contact with client projects. While this is an unavoidable part of the growth experience, this shift in management responsibilities can be difficult for leaders who have been used to tending to all the details themselves.

Many agency professionals initially started out in an agency environment because they enjoy working with clients on projects. This is why teaching leaders to take a step back and let their employees do their jobs without constant oversight is necessary to maintain overall organizational efficiency and, just as importantly, morale.

**4. Remember your roots**

With more money in play, more employees to manage and more locations from which work is conducted, it’s no surprise that management commonly loses sight of what made their company unique in the first place.

Organizations that scale effectively make room to cultivate their internal culture. Using chat services and reserving time for fun are excellent ways to keep an organization’s vision alive.

For HR teams looking to scale their organizations under deadlines, it can be difficult to know who to trust when it comes to business advice, but these few challenges seem to remain consistent across businesses that find themselves in the midst of a growth phase.
