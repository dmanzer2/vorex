SMBs are critical to the U.S. economy. Small businesses represent approximately half the private sector, and medium-sized businesses represent roughly one third, according to the Small Business Administration.

Ensuring that SMBs succeed can be an uphill battle. They face a unique set of challenges that can often be overcome through sound business practices bolstered by business management tools. Here are three common reasons SMBs fail and how a great business management platform can help.

1. **Working Harder, Not Smarter** — Not properly allocating your resources on projects and tasks that help move your company forward is a common mistake many growing companies make. Without proper insight into who is working on which projects and how much of their time is spent on each can introduce crippling operational inefficiencies. A business management platform can help you examine KPIs and determine if your employees are being over- or underutilized, for example.
2. **Using Outdated Tools to Manage Growth** — While business growth is the dream of every SMB, it creates new challenges, particularly when it comes to technology. Managing a company with a notebook and Excel spreadsheet isn’t scalable, especially for a business that grows from servicing 10 customers to 100 or more. Implementing technology and processes that better manage resource utilization, billing and finances can help you better accommodate company and customer growth.
3. **Not Capturing All Billings** — With many SMBs being service-oriented, accurately capturing billable hours is critical to your success. Accounting for every minute at the proper rate and capturing all expenses is beyond critical; not doing so can cost company profits and possibly jobs. By automating your operations with a business management platform, you can *save* thousands and *earn* These solutions help ensure a company is getting paid what they are worth and that no money (or service) is left unaccounted for.

Selecting a business management platform can be a critical step in helping your SMB succeed. But it’s vital that you choose a solution that’s a great fit for today’s needs and that can scale with you as you grow. Do a little homework to select the proper business management platform for your company – one that combines project management and professional services automation (PSA) for growing SMBs can dramatically impact bottom lines and enable you to get back to living life.
