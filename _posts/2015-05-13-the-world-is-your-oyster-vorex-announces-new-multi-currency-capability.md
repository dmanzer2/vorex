We’ve always been a company with a global vision. With international investors and executive leadership, it’s long been a focus of ours to help small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs), both domestically and abroad, optimize operations, improve profitability and achieve growth.

Inline with our mission, we’re excited to announce the release of multi-currency capability in our online business management software. This new feature will support more than 100 currencies and enable international companies to easily bill and complete financial transactions in their native currency directly within our platform.

So how does it work? Organizations have full command over their currency preference from their Vorex dashboard and can change currencies in their settings menu. There’s no backend lag time either – you can start using your new preferred currency instantly!

This new feature better equips international companies to manage and grow their businesses, while increasing profitability. We currently serve customers across North America, Europe, Australia, Africa and the Middle East with our online business management solution and are poised for even more global expansion in the years to come.

Our international customers rely on us to streamline their day-to-day operational tasks so they can free up time to focus on strategy and growing their businesses. From project management and time tracking, to invoicing and service desk ticketing, Vorex does it all – in one consolidated location. The addition of this new multi-currency capability will help our global customers streamline operations even further. Instead of having to manually convert numbers to different currencies, Vorex will now be able to bill, invoice and calculate in dozens of different currencies.

As a business owner or manager, you already have enough on your plate to worry about without adding time-consuming currency conversions into the mix. The new multi-currency feature will remove this headache and get you back to spending time on the big picture.

SMBs’ technology needs might vary, but they all have limited resources and a need for affordable software that helps them run their businesses smoothly. Vorex *is* this software. With cost-effective pricing and an easy-to-use but powerful interface, Vorex has the ability to change your business, your life and your world.
