New things are often greeted with suspicion, and sometimes for good reason. &#8216;New Coke&#8217; anyone?

It wasn&#8217;t very long ago that the new idea of conducting business in the cloud was regarded with similar suspicion. Especially in light of the stumbles of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/23/technology/23cloud.html?_r=0" target="_blank">early cloud computing giants like Amazon</a>. At one point, it seemed the cloud was destined to always look like some sort of technological &#8216;Wild West,&#8217; where the only rules were that there weren&#8217;t any.<!--more-->

Fast-forward a few years though, and cloud computing has <a href="https://virtualizationreview.com/articles/2014/11/10/90-percent-of-companies-using-cloud.aspx" target="_blank">gone mainstream</a>. According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/huawei/2015/04/16/cloud-data-center-trends-to-watch-for-in-2015/" target="_blank">International Data Group</a>, almost 70 percent of all businesses are using it in some fashion, with 20 percent more planning to do so soon. No longer the Wild West, the cloud has become as calm and predictable as watching cement harden.

Still, many businesses continue to lag in fully embracing what the cloud has to offer. For telecom companies, this resistance can be particularly detrimental. In the telecom industry, technology, vendor prices and market considerations are constantly shifting. So there&#8217;s a more pressing need for fast, flexible, fluid project and resource management.

An ERP and <a href="http://www.vorex.com/top-5-ways-cloud-based-project-management-provides-a-competitive-edge/#more-1440" target="_blank">project management platform</a> situated in the cloud offers those types of solutions. But in case you still need some convincing, here are five reasons why you should take your telecom company into the cloud.

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/PIh4laWJlz9bq/giphy.gif" alt="project management software" width="428" height="242" />

### 1. It Keeps Up

Technology marches on at a relentless, and at times, staggering pace. Over 31 million Facebook messages are sent <a href="http://www.cio.com/article/2915592/social-media/7-staggering-social-media-use-by-the-minute-stats.html#slide2" target="_blank">each minute</a>. Time and talk&#8211;in business and in life&#8211;just aren&#8217;t what they used to be. For telecom companies looking to gain or maintain an edge, keeping up is essential.

But staying on top of hardware and software updates eats up time you could be spending doing more important things, like watching <a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/cat-tambourine-FqceLVUMUfDws" target="_blank">cat videos</a>, or arguing vehemently with complete strangers in comment threads.

Thankfully, with cloud-based solutions, updating and upgrading are handled automatically and off-site. So you can keep up without time-consuming software updates or having to disrupt workflow or business operations.

### 2. It&#8217;s Cheaper Than DIY

As more and more businesses and service providers have adopted cloud-based solutions, the cost has dropped. Even if that weren&#8217;t the case, however, cloud-based project management and ERP can save you money by enabling you to cut back on personnel, the number of servers you maintain, and the cost of energy it takes to run them.

### 3. It&#8217;s Real-Time

Learning from the past to improve efficiencies is valuable, but what&#8217;s happening right now is also critical to success in business. A <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/" target="_blank">cloud-based ERP and project management platform</a> keeps you in &#8216;the know&#8217; by keeping you in &#8216;the now.&#8217;

Access inventory numbers with a single glance at a dashboard. Stay on top of procurement needs and vendor issues as they happen. With a cloud-based ERP and project management platform, you&#8217;re able to track what&#8217;s happening in real-time, process and analyze information as it comes in and act upon that information in a timely manner.

### 4. It&#8217;s Nimble

The cloud creates flexibility in how and where we choose to work. Business managers that rely on a cloud-based solution are able to employ remote workforces and scale up or down with ease as projects and workload ebb and flow.

### 5. It Makes Integration Possible

Tired of moving between various softwares, platforms, spreadsheets and data sets? Platform fatigue is a growing issue, but with a unified system to keep your business on track you can manage everything from <a href="http://www.vorex.com/why-erp-is-a-must-for-project-based-businesses/#more-1445" target="_blank">a single dashboard</a>. Not only does this free up time and increase productivity, but it also gives you access to your company&#8217;s big picture like never before.

So, even though &#8216;New Coke&#8217; didn&#8217;t work out, not everything new is bad. New York, after all, turned out to be pretty good, the New Kids on the Block were alright (if you&#8217;re into that kind of thing).

So rather than being standoffish towards new technology like you were to the new kid at school, why not get your head in the cloud and take your telecom company with you?

With a nimble and integrated cloud-based ERP and project management platform, you&#8217;ll find it&#8217;s possible to lower costs and increase productivity.
