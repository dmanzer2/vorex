Professional service automation (PSA) software has revolutionized the day-to-day operations of many organizations. PSAs enable professionals to better leverage technology to tackle the kind of day-to-day tasks that would normally require spending hours with your head buried in a spreadsheet, freeing you up to do more important things like drumming up new business and assisting your existing clients.

Whether it’s tracking time spent with clients, or managing your resource allocation for future projects, PSA software has changed the game. Let’s take a look at seven features that should consider when shopping for PSA software.

### 1. Usability

First and foremost, your PSA has to be the kind of solution you can interact with over and over again, day in and day out. Even the most powerful tools won’t do you any good if they never come off the shelf.

It goes [beyond ease-of-use](http://www.wqusability.com/articles/more-than-ease-of-use.html), however. Yes, a good PSA should be intuitive, but it should also have a short learning curve that’s easy to master and provide a user experience that’s engaging enough for your team members not to dread having to get their work done.

### 2. Adaptable Time Tracking

There are plenty of ways to track your time at work, but not all of them offer the same value. It’s important to make sure your PSA’s [time tracking and reporting capabilities are robust and flexible](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/). Billing and resource management integration are also key.

### 3. Billing and Invoicing

Most, if not all, PSAs offer some kind of billing and invoicing functionality. But how complex and adaptable that functionality is can be the difference between software that rises to the occasion…and something that rarely gets used. Making sure your PSA solution can handle whatever type of billing or invoicing your company needs is a major factor in your decision.

### 4. Integration

Any individual component of your organization’s software ecosystem is only as strong as its ability to interact with your entire workflow. Many PSA providers offer [integrations with commonly used business software](http://www.vorex.com/media/new-vorex-winter-2015-release-simplifies-online-project-management-for-smbs-and-professional-services-organizations/). But it’s important to ensure the software you choose will integrate easily with your organization’s existing systems, as well as accommodate seamless integrations with other solutions as your organization grows and evolves.

### 5. Resource Allocation & Planning

An effective PSA solution should provide [unparalleled visibility](http://www.vorex.com/how-to-leverage-real-time-visibility-for-better-resource-allocation/) into the flow of resources across your organization, enabling you to make the most informed decisions possible. Good PSA software should also offer easy to understand, visual resource management so you can easily keep track of resources.

### 6. Cloud-based

To put it simply: if your business software isn’t living on the cloud by now, you’ve got to get with the times. Cloud-based software can be [key to maintaining a competitive edge](http://www.vorex.com/top-5-ways-cloud-based-project-management-provides-a-competitive-edge/) in today’s rapidly shifting business landscape. Using a cloud-based PSA will allow your team to stay connected to vital aspects of your operation wherever they are and whenever the need arises.

### 7. Ongoing Support

Any PSA worth its salt is going to have to be backed with strong, ongoing support from its developer. Make sure your PSA vendor is there when you need them to answer questions as they arise. This is crucial to developing and maintaining an enduring and productive working relationship.

Your PSA solution helps ensure your operation runs smoothly. Checking off a list of functionality is the first step to keeping everyone on the same page and making sure your business is poised for success. Selecting the right PSA that balances functionality with simplicity is the key to keeping your organization moving forward. So make sure the vendor you partner with is willing to engage with you in order to keep it running strongly.
