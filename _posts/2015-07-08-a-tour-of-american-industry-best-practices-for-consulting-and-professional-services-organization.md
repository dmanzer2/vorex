Professional services organizations (PSOs) provide counsel, insight and action for organizations across a wide array of industries. As such, they encounter the unique business challenges of each industry they serve, and those seem to grow more complex by the day, especially with shifts in technology.

Running a PSO involves managing fragmented solutions and platforms for project management, billing, invoicing, time tracking and other tasks. This fragmentation can result in frustration and inefficient, time-consuming processes that hinder business operations.

[Finding success as a PSO](http://aberdeen.com/research/8709/ra-professional-services-automation/content.aspx) is no easy task, but there are a number of best practices that can greatly improve those odds.

**Better Customer Relations**

The best customer any business has is the one they already have. [As quoted by Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jerryjao/2014/11/19/why-customer-retention-is-king-the-evolution-of-retention-marketing-part-1/), “According to Gartner Group, 80% of your company’s future revenue will come from just 20% of your existing customers.” [Good customer relations](http://www.vorex.com/why-being-a-design-driven-company-leads-to-the-best-customer-experience/), then, require good customer retention.

So what’s the foundation for a solid customer retention strategy? Utilization of an [intuitive, and robust customer relationship management (CRM) tool](http://www.vorex.com/product/customer-relationship-management/) that can help you keep track of and organize client data and relationships. It also helps if the CRM integrates with your current office solutions to enable a seamless customer record..

**Project Profitability**

Accurately tracking each project’s time and expense lies at the heart of keeping your profit margins high. To maintain a project’s profitability, you’ll want your team tracking its time and expenses with a tool that can help quickly and easily keep tallies on multiple accounts, employees and projects, and then [automatically generate invoices](http://www.vorex.com/product/billing-invoicing-tracking/).

From reducing errors in billable time and expense accounting to knowing who among your employees can take on more work and who can’t, the increased knowledge provided by a professional services automation (PSA) solution will increase profitability across the board.

**Improved Cash Flow**

Historically, invoicing has been unnecessarily complex and a major time drain. Of the 770,000PSOs in the U.S., [15 percent reported no growth last year](http://www.vorex.com/the-1-tool-agency-owners-use-to-battle-the-odds/), while 10 percent reported a net loss.

Whether you need invoicing based on fixed-prices, subscription services, multiple currencies or billable hours, a PSA solution can improve cash flow issues. By streamlining processes, cutting down on errors and assisting in the creation of client contracts, agency owners can more easily manage, grow and track their businesses in a single web-based application.

**Better Resource Allocation**

Running on a thin margin is usually part of the deal when it comes to running a consulting agency. This is exactly why [optimizing resource allocation](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/strategy/how_to_put_your_money_where_your_strategy_is) is essential to success.

Gaining better insight into the profitability of your operations is difficult to come by if you’re simply “eyeing it.” It’s nearly impossible to track and analyze who is working on what and how much you’re spending in different areas without some kind of tracking tool.

Using a business management solution provides the ability to more effectively align the right employees with the right projects as they roll in. Hiring can become a data-based endeavor, and you’ll also be able to address training and skill needs within your staff. In short, better resource allocation allows you the control to make sure every project comes in on-time and on-budget.
