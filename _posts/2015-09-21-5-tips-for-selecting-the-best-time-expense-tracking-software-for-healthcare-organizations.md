<span style="font-weight: 400;">In healthcare, the focus is on keeping patients healthy. Each minute is spent trying to ensure people live long, full lives, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">not on minding every penny</span>](http://i.imgur.com/y35eMUa.jpg) <span style="font-weight: 400;">and every stray second.</span>

**** ****<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, in today&#8217;s world, as the cost of healthcare increases for patients and the market adjusts to decreased margins for practices, efficiency has become more important than ever. When it comes to matters of life or death, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">every minute</span>](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;and every penny&#8211;can make a dramatic difference in providing excellent care. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Which is why healthcare organizations looking to </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">build efficiencies into their operations</span>](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/uncovering-cost-efficiency-measures-within-healthcare-systems-building-portfolios.html) <span style="font-weight: 400;">are increasingly turning to time and expense tracking software. </span>

**** ****<span style="font-weight: 400;">While there are </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">dozens of options</span>](http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/6730-best-time-and-attendance-systems.html) <span style="font-weight: 400;">for businesses in most industries, healthcare organizations have a specific set of standards to get the most out of their software.</span>

**** ****Here are five tips for healthcare organizations looking to invest in new time and expense tracking software to ensure they find the best match for their organizational needs.**** ****

  1.  **Know What You Don&#8217;t Know**

When Neo asked Morpheus, [<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is The Matrix?&#8221;</span>](https://youtu.be/te6qG4yn-Ps?t=2m54s) <span style="font-weight: 400;">the mentor made his answer simple: Nobody can be told what The Matrix is. They have to see it to understand. This is exactly how healthcare organizations need to look at software solutions.</span>

**** ****<span style="font-weight: 400;">Assess the financial health and productivity of where you are today as an organization. In many healthcare organizations&#8211;especially smaller practices&#8211;the</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">day-to-day work</span>](http://www.healthit.gov/providers-professionals/medical-practice-efficiencies-cost-savings) <span style="font-weight: 400;">of treating patients can leave a thick haze when it comes time to analyzing expenses or time spent on work.</span>

**** ****<span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">recent article</span>](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/765783_3) <span style="font-weight: 400;">in Medscape, &#8220;Just as you routinely monitor your patients&#8217; vital signs and order regular laboratory tests, it is important to routinely monitor the vital signs&#8221; of your organization. With that in mind, take the time to thoroughly audit your finances and employee productivity before making any steps toward a software solution.</span>

Once you have a clear picture of your time and expenses, it&#8217;s time to make the move into a new world of technology.**** ****

<ol start="2">
  <ol start="2">
    <li>
      <b> Assess Goals First</b>
    </li>
  </ol>
</ol>

Once it&#8217;s clear that you need technology, it&#8217;s important to know what your organization&#8217;s goals are. Imagine if [<span style="font-weight: 400;">Wile E. Coyote</span>](https://youtu.be/STeVTzWelns?t=18s) <span style="font-weight: 400;">lacked focus. He knows his goal&#8211;to get the Road Runner (or, in special cases, Bugs Bunny).</span>

<img class="" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/mTXSKTk3BsT6w/giphy.gif" alt="project management" width="393" height="295" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your organization must define its Road Runner. Does that mean improving per-patient workflows?  </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Lowering supply costs</span>](http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20141122/MAGAZINE/311229980)<span style="font-weight: 400;">? Increasing worker efficiency? Each goal might have a different set of metrics for success.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">By having set goals, an organization can avoid one of the problems that Mr. Coyote runs into all the time: </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Making things too complicated</span>](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_o1SbmQeWUE/UhYXsekdh1I/AAAAAAAAAQ4/-F73KMYmGt8/s1600/ACME100print.jpg)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. The reality is that no software solution can be all things to all people.</span>

Without setting goals ahead of time, an organization could be distracted from its true needs by bells and whistles or by perceived needs that might conflict with actual needs. With a focus and with goals, organizations can get the best bang for their buck &#8212; and the best results for patients.

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    <b> Look to The Future</b>
  </li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If one of the goals of your organization is growth, then any software solution must have the ability to grow with you. Choosing a solution that meets the needs of your organization while allowing for </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">scaling upward</span>](http://www.slideshare.net/dsrosenblum/software-system-scalability-concepts-and-techniques-keynote-talk-at-isec-2009) <span style="font-weight: 400;">(or downward) is one of the first steps to increased efficiency.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the simplest terms, your organization will get the most from its software by </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">thinking BIG &#8212; and small</span>](https://static2.artfire.com/uploads/product/2/362/58362/2358362/2358362/large/alice_in_wonderland_-_drink_me_and_eat_me_earrings_-_sterling_silver_a8451602.jpg)<span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some solutions provide only coverage of small organizations, while</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">others</span>](http://www.mytimeforce.com/solutions/industries/healthcare) <span style="font-weight: 400;">have</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">options</span>](http://www.teletracking.com/solutions/#Labor-Productivity) <span style="font-weight: 400;">for small, midsize and enterprise organizations. The ability to move new employees or new expenses into the software solutions seamlessly will mean more success in the long run.</span>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    <b> Think Beyond Basic</b>
  </li>
</ol>

The best part about having a set goal and looking ahead to the future is that your organization will not only know what it needs but what it doesn&#8217;t need. When it comes to tracking time and expenses, that can be massive.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about it. You buy a new car, and the dealer keeps asking about the </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">True Coat sealant</span>](http://cdn.left.mn/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/william-h-macy-and-jerry-lundegaard-Exposure.jpg?f56a5f)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. It sure sounds good, but do you really need it? Sometimes, the answer is no.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">True, your organization might not be able to predict the future with 100 percent certainty (only </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Biff Tannen</span>](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lzozwuhz1D1rpddw7o1_500.jpg) <span style="font-weight: 400;">can do that), but by doing the work ahead of time, a healthcare organization can have a pretty good idea where payments, time and the industry might be headed &#8212; and it can choose a software solution that fits those needs properly.</span>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    <b> Get A Second Opinion</b>
  </li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as a patient might look </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">beyond the first opinion</span>](http://www.cfah.org/prepared-patient/make-good-treatment-decisions/should-i-get-a-second-opinion) <span style="font-weight: 400;">to find a diagnosis, healthcare organizations should weigh their options before picking a time and expense tracking solution. While the first option might indeed be the best, there is always a benefit to looking at all the possibilities.</span>
