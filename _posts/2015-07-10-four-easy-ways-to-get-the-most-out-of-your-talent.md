Keeping track of the talent and skills on your team can be like that old [“Who’s on First”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTcRRaXV-fg) comedy skit from Abbott and Costello. Knowing who can do what is essential to making the best project assignments and growing your company, but as your company grows, it can become increasingly difficult to manage your team effectively.

That’s why today’s top HR professionals are looking to [business management platforms](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) to help HR teams and management better track and utilize employee’s talents. Here are four easy ways a business management platform can help you get the most out of your talent.

1. **Searchable Skill Sets**

There are plenty of reasons why a [team might not work](https://hbr.org/2009/05/why-teams-dont-work) well together, so from the beginning, it’s important to make sure you’re assigning the right people to the right projects. Of course, remembering each of your employees’ skill sets and preferences, and keeping track of their completed training courses and professional certifications, would require a memory even an elephant would envy.

But, maintaining current employee profiles that can be easily updated when someone on the team learns a new skill or gains new experience is *key* in managing the team’s resources. Not to mention, assigning team members to specific projects or clients becomes easier when you can quickly search for employees by the skills and experience a particular project requires.

1. ** Smart Growth**

When it comes time to invest in talent to grow your business or to replace outgoing team members, it’s good to have a way to quickly see what skills are already accounted for in your organization and where your team needs rounding out

Along with helping you [pick the right job candidates](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/), having an at-a-glance summary of your organization’s talent will save you from having to conduct a skills inventory each time you’re ready to hire.

Employee profiles can also help identify the next generation of leaders on your team. Over time, you can see which employees are gaining the necessary tools to make them candidates for future promotions.

1. ** Make Happy a Priority**

Perhaps one of the fastest ways to lose a customer or client is to take on more than you can handle. Landing big projects feels great, but if you take on a project only to realize you don’t have the resources needed to complete it properly, that “great” feeling can quickly lead to dread.

Coupling an employee profile tool with a [project monitoring tool](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) provides you with the information you need to know which employees–and which skills and talents–are available when a new project kicks off.

Having a handle on your team’s skills and allocating resources efficiently will help you make sure you’re pursuing and taking on work that aligns with the skillset at your organization.

That’s certainly beneficial to your clients, but can also go a long way in keeping employees productive and their morale high.

Assigning employees to projects that utilize their best skills and offers them the chance to grow provides a more rewarding experience than dealing with the frustration of working on a poorly matched project.

1. ** Don&#8217;t Train In Vain**

Knowing which skills are available and which educational opportunities team members have taken advantage of can help managers plan additional training that is beneficial to both the organization and employees.

By 2025 Millenials — people born between 1979 and 1994 — will make up [75% of the global workforce](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2013/09/17/do-millennials-think-differently-about-money-and-career/). In addition to salary and benefits packages in their positions, 85% of Millenials want [work that makes a difference](http://www.forbes.com/sites/karstenstrauss/2013/09/17/do-millennials-think-differently-about-money-and-career/) and is enriching to themselves and the world.

An [EdAssist survey](http://www.edassist.com/resources/news-releases/2015/04/Millennials-study-press) found that given the choice between two similar jobs, almost 60% of Millenials would take a position with potential for professional development over one with regular pay raises.

Implementing a business management platform can improve insight into employee skillsets and training, as well as provide better visibility into resource availability for current and potential projects. Knowing Who’s on first and What’s on second can not only help you more intelligently leverage your talent and respond to customer requests, it can help you more smartly grow your company.
