Meeting with a client face-to-face is one of the best ways to determine how to meet their needs…in theory. Unfortunately, we all know what it’s like to be on an hour-and-a-half conference call that could’ve been summed up in a two sentence email. Or to attend a meeting that ends up being all about planning another meeting.<!--more-->

So how do you make sure that your meetings serve the needs of both you and your clients? Here are four goals to always keep in mind.

**Set An Agenda with a Hard Stop**

Know what you’re going to say, and know how long you have to say it. [Setting an agenda](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2007/08/16/the-not-to-do-list-9-habits-to-stop-now/) and following it so that your team is focusing on one topic at a time is much more efficient than general spit-balling, and often produces better results.

Once a specific topic has been discussed to everyone’s satisfaction, put it away and move on. And with a specific number of topics to discuss in a specific amount of time, people feel less inclined to drag on minor details that your client likely doesn’t need to worry about.

**Assign Tasks To Specific People**

One of the worst things that can happen after a meeting is having to schedule another meeting so people know what to do with all the information they just digested.

By quickly and cleanly assigning jobs to specific individuals, people will focus on what they’re told to, and go forth with a much more clear vision of what they need to do. As such, everyone becomes an expert, rather than trying to be a jack-of-all-trades.

**Set Internal Deadlines** \*\*

\*\* Deadlines allow you to meet [drop-dead dates](http://adsubculture.com/articles/2011/2/23/managing-the-drop-dead-date.html) for deliverables because we all know that urgency is an excellent motivator. If tasks are allowed to be completed “whenever,” then they’ll be completed “whenever” (read: never).

By setting numerous deadlines at various stages, the whole project becomes easier to manage by virtue of breaking it into small, easily-accomplished tasks, which in turn keeps morale high and progress quick.

It’s important to note that these should all be internal deadlines. All the client needs to know is when you’ll deliver the final product. Deadlines are naturally stressful, and having to meet them for a third party is much more stressful than having to meet them for friends and trusted co-workers.

**Use Project Management Software**

[Project management software](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) tracks all the meeting details and keeps the “minutes” for easy reference. We have a tendency to romanticize the mad genius with stacks of papers strewn about in a cluster of organized chaos that only they know by heart.

But there’s a reason that that mad genius only works alone: to everyone else, it’s just chaos. A strong team needs to be able to think cohesively, and that requires strong organization.

There are myriad software tools out there to help you keep track of projects, [manage workflow and deadlines](http://www.vorex.com/take-your-digital-organization-higher-with-a-cloud-based-solution/), and most importantly to collect and pass along notes and information.

As project manager, your job is to make sure that everyone has everything they need to do their job the best they can; you need to have everything you need to do your job, too.
