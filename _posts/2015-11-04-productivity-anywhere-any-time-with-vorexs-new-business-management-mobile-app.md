Here at Vorex we believe in the convenience and [productivity that comes from being able to access your work and essential business information anywhere](http://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/76-percent-of-employees-are-more-productive-when-they-leave-the-office.html) and any time. We have always enabled our users to do this with Vorex’s cloud-based platform, but now we’re kicking things up a notch with a new mobile app!

Aptly named Vorex Disconnected, this app gives users the ability to access the Vorex business management platform from any device no matter where they are, even if they’re offline.

With this new powerful and intuitive app, users can now track their time and expenses, manage help desk tickets and streamline their business operations even if they’re outside the office or without Wi-Fi access.

We designed this app to give people more flexibility in a world where workforces are becoming more remote and the demands on employees’ time require them [to be more mobile](http://mashable.com/2011/08/08/mobile-workers-infographic/#YDQJyNZilSqU).

In fact, by 2020 it’s estimated that almost [75 percent of the workforce](http://www.telecompetitor.com/idc-mobile-workers-will-make-up-nearly-75-percent-of-u-s-workforce/) will be comprised of mobile workers. With this new app employees and managers will be able to access important files and business analytics with the click of a few buttons no matter where they are, ensuring they never miss a beat and always have the ability to respond to issues in a timely manner.

The app is currently available on all iOS and Android supported devices, and can be updated while offline. This new mobile app was designed to benefit companies in all industries but particularly those including IT service providers and MSPs, telecom, public relations and marketing agencies, consulting and healthcare. For any organization managing multiple accounts, clients or a variety of data, Vorex is the perfect solution to keep everything streamlined and organized.

Key Vorex mobile app features include:

* **Time Tracking** - Users can create and edit new timesheets, add time against a specific task or support ticket and keep track of hours spent on particular projects. This enables business owners and project managers to have better insight into project progress and more accurately allocate resources.
* **Expense Reporting** – Users can create and edit expense sheets, add receipts and view total spending, making it easier to manage budgets, employee reimbursements and billable expenses.
* **Help Desk & Ticketing** – Managing support tickets is made easier with the option to add new or edit existing help desk tickets, update the status or progress and get notifications on any activity.
* **Offline Capabilities** - With the ability to make edits and updates even when there’s no broadband connection, users can use the app any time, anywhere. This helps employees boost productivity and complete tasks on the go.

These are just some of the key features you’ll find in the Vorex mobile app, designed to make your life easier whether you’re on the go or in the office.
