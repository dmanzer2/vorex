We know Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) are a seriously overworked group of professionals. Being in a service-oriented industry is never easy, <a href="http://www.cpapracticeadvisor.com/news/12055950/what-are-the-biggest-accounting-challenges-small-businesses-face" target="_blank">but CPAs face extra challenges</a> including dealing with complex and highly sensitive data and the need for real-time insight into operations to maximize profitability.<!--more-->

Luckily, there&#8217;s a simple and affordable solution specifically tailored to CPAs and small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs) &#8211; Vorex&#8217;s business management and professional services automation (PSA) platform. Today, Vorex is sponsoring and exhibiting at the <a href="http://www.aicpaconferencematerials.com/techpractitioners/?select=conference&conferenceID=13" target="_blank">2015 Practitioners Symposium and TECH+ Conference</a>, which unites three leading organizations in the accounting industry. Vorex will be showcasing and demoing its multi-purpose platform at booth 211 to show CPAs and financial industry professionals how a well-designed business management platform can change their business, their life and their world.

Vorex combines project management and professional services automation (PSA) tools into [a single business management solution](http://www.vorex.com/product/) that&#8217;s ideal for financial industry professionals looking to streamline day-to-day business operations. If you&#8217;ve ever found it a near impossible challenge to juggle the day-to-day responsibilities of managing a business while simultaneously keeping the big picture in mind _and_ looking for growth opportunities, then you&#8217;re not alone. Vorex was designed help small business owners and project managers free up their time to focus on strategies for growth, rather than daily operations

What we love most about this year&#8217;s Practitioners Symposium and TECH+ Conference is its commitment to bringing industry professionals unique learning programs. Education at the event centers around a focus on technology designed to handle issues commonly faced by CPA firms, as well as core issues faced by SMBs including compensation, firm efficiencies, billing practices, fee pressure and collection.

We are so excited to be participating in this educational industry event and truly believe our platform can change the way the CPA community does business. If you&#8217;re at the event stop by booth 211 to experience first-hand what Vorex can do for _you_ and your business growth.
