Effective business management is all about making informed decisions and relying on insights gleaned from data in order to stay ahead of the curve. Determining what data is important and which doesn’t factor into the equation plays a major part in finding success.<!--more-->

Here we’ve compiled 10 statistics related to business management solutions that could change your perspective on how you and your organization approach the work you do.

Believe it or not, **only 2.5% of companies successfully complete 100% of their projects** [according to research](http://www.gallup.com/businessjournal/152429/cost-bad-project-management.aspx) from PricewaterhouseCoopers. No matter how skilled and prepared your organization is, everyone experiences unexpected bumps in the road that derail at least some of the projects they attempt.

Keeping a healthy dialogue going is crucial to completing a project successfully, because **57% of projects fail** [**due to a “breakdown in communications.”**](http://www.it-cortex.com/Stat_Failure_Cause.htm) Having a system to help you track and manage all the moving parts and team members involved in a project can make a huge difference in terms of completion.

The larger the project is [the more likely it is to fail](http://www.unanet.com/content/project-success-rates-%E2%80%93-progress-over-time-maturity-and-tools-matter), and **28% of large projects do fail,** so it’s important to plan ahead to ensure your team has the tools it needs to [communicate effectively](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/).

[**46% of organizations admit to not fully understanding the value of project management,**](http://www.pmi.org/~/media/PDF/Business-Solutions/PMI_Pulse_2014.ashx) **even though that understanding boosts the success rate of strategic initiatives by 16%.** Investing in a unified [business management solution](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) offers an easy and effective way to increase the overall success rate of your organization’s projects.

According to a study by the [Aberdeen Group](http://www.aberdeen.com/research/8702/ai-project-resource-scheduling/content.aspx), **“manual processes around client billing can cause error rates of 12%-15%**.**”** Automating these processes and integrating them into a larger business management system can help you avoid serious errors that cost unnecessary time and resources and leave your company in an [awkward position with clients](http://www.vorex.com/the-1-hack-for-capturing-billable-hours-without-error/).

Cloud-based management solutions are on the rise and growing bigger and better every day. [**87% of businesses are using a cloud-based solution**](http://www.vorex.com/take-your-digital-organization-higher-with-a-cloud-based-solution/) to keep their resources organized in one central location.

Many companies are turning to an integrated system that combines project management, resource allocation, expense tracking and more. **108.7 billion business emails are sent and received every day,** and [the right system](http://www.vorex.com/take-your-digital-organization-higher-with-a-cloud-based-solution/) will help your organization track all communication and keep the work organized.

Help desk and ticketing plays an important part in the big picture of any managed service provider (MSP) organization, and efficiency is key to managing these functions.

**The average Net Level 1**[ **resolution rate for U.S. in-house service desks is 85.4%**](https://www.metricnet.com/help-desk-statistics) — if your organization is failing to meet your benchmarks, a complete [help desk and ticketing solution](http://www.vorex.com/product/help-desk-and-ticketing/) might be just what the doctor ordered to get you better organized and on track.

Everyone is talking about the importance of having a SaaS customer relationship management (CRM) solution, but what does that translate to on the financial side? [**The average ROI for CRM is $5.60**](http://blog.getbase.com/18-surprising-crm-statistics) **for every dollar spent.**

In fact, according to [SalesLoft](http://salesloft.com/resources/blog/2013/09/crm-stats-good-bad-ugly-infographic), **CRM is the #1 enterprise software in projected growth.** In addition, **t**he value of [CRM](http://www.vorex.com/product/customer-relationship-management/) software can be multiplied when it’s integrated as part of an all-in-one business management solution.
