In life as well as business, incomplete truths can be just as damaging as out-and-out falsehoods. With big data and analytics expanding and fueling [how work gets done](http://www.wsj.com/articles/data-is-the-new-middle-manager-1429478017), “seeing” that data is just as important as having it.<!--more-->

Major companies like [UPS spend more than $1 billion](https://datafloq.com/read/ups-spends-1-billion-big-data-annually/273) a year gathering, analyzing and applying big data. The better their visibility into those vast storehouses of information, the greater their rewards.

Whether you’re a small business or a growing corporation is beside the point. There’s never been a better time to leverage real-time visibility into data than now–especially when it comes to [resource allocation](http://www.vorex.com/your-shorthand-guide-to-better-resource-allocation/).

### The Blind Men and The Beast

In the classic, Indian tale of the blind men describing an elephant by touch, this lesson is at the fore. To the man holding on to the trunk, the elephant is long and sinewy. To the one at its leg, it is thick and wrinkly. The man at its tail can conclude nothing but that the beast is on the puny side.

Needless to say, it would be difficult for them to apply anything accurate about what the marvelous animal beneath their wandering hands can do because they don’t have a complete picture.

### The Importance of Resource Allocation

It doesn’t matter what industry you’re in: Having the resources to succeed isn’t enough. You must also allocate and balance those resources well and with a flexibility that can respond to project and task flow in real-time.

Simply put: Better resource allocation–especially of people–yields greater efficiency. [Just ask Google.](http://www.eremedia.com/tlnt/how-google-is-using-people-analytics-to-completely-reinvent-hr/) However, just because you have access to the data that might yield better resource allocation doesn’t mean you know how to use it.

Regardless of whether you were even [aware of needing or wanting to know it](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/upshot/if-algorithms-know-all-how-much-should-humans-help.html?_r=0&amp;abt=0002&amp;abg=0), big data and analytics can show you all you need to know. How in the world are you supposed to gain insight into it?

### Seeing is Allocating

Benjamin Franklin once declared, “We are all born ignorant, but one must work hard to remain stupid.” The difficult and tedious work of combing through spreadsheets, data sets and reports to run a business effectively has ended. Data can now be visualized.

All you need is a software solution that gives you a holistic view into every resource.

### The Visual Dashboard

With a hearty [project management software](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) that includes a visual dashboard, you can instantly see, know and act on vital intel. Add employees to projects that are running behind before they go off the rails. Keep track of what work is coming down the pipeline so you can more efficiently hire more muscle.

With a visual dashboard, you get a window into all the work your company is doing and the people who are doing it. The result is easier, more on-target management, projects that are on-time and on-budget, and employees who have what they need before they need it.

Don’t spend another workday trying to gain access into just one of the many projects in your care. Find a business management software solution with a visual dashboard that can grant you deep insight into every single one of them.

The future of work is here, and you can get a great view of its elephant. Resource allocation doesn’t need to be complicated. Implement a [business management platform](http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/) designed to move businesses like yours forward.
