<span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a famous quote out there that all businesses should learn and remember:</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You know what works? Let&#8217;s make sure we use as many different solutions as possible.&#8221; </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">- No boss ever.</span><!--more-->

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In today&#8217;s business world, data and functionality cross from department to department, from the sales team to human resources to manufacturing. Why would anyone want to have a different solution for every department and every project?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Actually, there are companies that believe in making things as complicated as possible. Those are the companies that end up with TPS Reports and a guy named Lumburgh who wants you to come in on Saturday.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, that&#8217;d be great.</span>

### A Modern Solution

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The truth is that companies are looking for ways to make the most of their data and to make work functions easier across every department. That&#8217;s where the modern</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">enterprise resource planning</span>](http://www.modernerp.com/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">(ERP) solution comes in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The beauty of ERP systems is that they can help your company spot trends among your clients and</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">allow you to be nimble</span>](http://www.vorex.com/how-online-project-management-erp-can-help-digital-agencies-advance-their-businesses/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">in assigning resources to those clients. When ERP functionality is combined within the right project management system companies can bring efficiency to the next level.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The skeptic reads about ERP systems and says, &#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s what my CRM does, right?&#8221;</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No. You would be wrong, McFly. Think about it. Just think.</span>

### Looking Inward

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When Morpheus tells Neo he&#8217;s The One, Neo doesn&#8217;t believe it. No matter how many times people told Keanu he was the one, he just didn&#8217;t want to think it was true. And you know what? It wasn&#8217;t &#8212; until he believed it himself.</span>

<img class="aligncenter" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fXm3axbRDLBII/giphy.gif" alt="project management software" width="428" height="242" />

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like Neo, companies use a CRM to gather data and react with their eye on those outside the company walls &#8212; the consumer. ERP, on the other hand,</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">looks inward</span>](http://www.crmswitch.com/crm-value/understanding-crm-erp/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">. ERP is about Neo believing he is The One.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And when your</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">systems are efficient</span>](http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, you can provide better service and products to the consumers who fill your CRM. It&#8217;s all one big cycle of success. Because there is no spoon.</span>

### Which Way is Up

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue for many companies is that ERP systems have been a little one-size-fits-all, and we all know how that can work out. Ask anyone who&#8217;s tried on one of those one-size-fits-all Halloween costumes. Sometimes, it just doesn&#8217;t work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The modern ERP &#8212; or</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">postmodern ERP</span>](http://www.netsuiteblogs.com/how-does-netsuite-fit-gartners-definition-of-postmodern-erp)<span style="font-weight: 400;">, as one blog called it &#8212; can be different for every company. Getting a one-size ERP is a bit like Elmer Fudd asking Bugs Bunny for directions. Sure, he might find the wabbit eventually, but he&#8217;ll probably end up with something blowing up in his face.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The smart company looks inward again, discovering what processes cross paths, assessing what goals exist and looking at what&#8217;s really needed. Then they can go out and</span> [<span style="font-weight: 400;">find the solution</span>](http://www.vorex.com/i-choose-you-selecting-the-best-erp-for-your-organization/) <span style="font-weight: 400;">that best fits their needs.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the end, the work you do will be better for your bottom line because it&#8217;s done more efficiently while giving the customer more. When that happens, we&#8217;re all winners. And not some gold-stars-for-participation medal-type winners.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Real. Winners.</span>
