There’s a famous quote out there that all businesses should learn and remember:

“You know what works? Let’s make sure we use as many different solutions as possible.”

- No boss ever.

In today’s business world, data and functionality cross from department to department, from the sales team to human resources to manufacturing. Why would anyone want to have a different solution for every department and every project?

Actually, there are companies that believe in making things as complicated as possible. Those are the companies that end up with TPS Reports and a guy named Lumburgh who wants you to come in on Saturday.

Yeah, that’d be great.

### A Modern Solution

The truth is that companies are looking for ways to make the most of their data and to make work functions easier across every department. That’s where the modern [enterprise resource planning](http://www.modernerp.com/) (ERP) solution comes in.

The beauty of ERP systems is that they can help your company spot trends among your clients and [allow you to be nimble](http://www.vorex.com/how-online-project-management-erp-can-help-digital-agencies-advance-their-businesses/) in assigning resources to those clients. When ERP functionality is combined within the right project management system companies can bring efficiency to the next level.

The skeptic reads about ERP systems and says, “Hey, that’s what my CRM does, right?”

No. You would be wrong, McFly. Think about it. Just think.

### Looking Inward

When Morpheus tells Neo he’s The One, Neo doesn’t believe it. No matter how many times people told Keanu he was the one, he just didn’t want to think it was true. And you know what? It wasn’t — until he believed it himself.

Much like Neo, companies use a CRM to gather data and react with their eye on those outside the company walls — the consumer. ERP, on the other hand, [looks inward](http://www.crmswitch.com/crm-value/understanding-crm-erp/). ERP is about Neo believing he is The One.

And when your [systems are efficient](http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/), you can provide better service and products to the consumers who fill your CRM. It’s all one big cycle of success. Because there is no spoon.

### Which Way is Up

The issue for many companies is that ERP systems have been a little one-size-fits-all, and we all know how that can work out. Ask anyone who’s tried on one of those one-size-fits-all Halloween costumes. Sometimes, it just doesn’t work.

The modern ERP — or [postmodern ERP](http://www.netsuiteblogs.com/how-does-netsuite-fit-gartners-definition-of-postmodern-erp), as one blog called it — can be different for every company. Getting a one-size ERP is a bit like Elmer Fudd asking Bugs Bunny for directions. Sure, he might find the wabbit eventually, but he’ll probably end up with something blowing up in his face.

The smart company looks inward again, discovering what processes cross paths, assessing what goals exist and looking at what’s really needed. Then they can go out and [find the solution](http://www.vorex.com/i-choose-you-selecting-the-best-erp-for-your-organization/) that best fits their needs.

In the end, the work you do will be better for your bottom line because it’s done more efficiently while giving the customer more. When that happens, we’re all winners. And not some gold-stars-for-participation medal-type winners.

Real. Winners.
