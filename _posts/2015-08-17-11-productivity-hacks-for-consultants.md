Everyone’s goal is to be more productive during the day, whether at work or doing chores around the house. The key is to [work smarter not harder.](http://www.vorex.com/streamline-day-to-day-operations-work-smarter-not-harder/) By adapting these 11 productivity hacks, you can get more accomplished during the day, do better work and minimize the kind of crippling stress that can lead to burnout.

### Don’t Check Your Email First Thing

This may seem counterintuitive, but [checking your email first thing](http://www.inc.com/david-finkel/12-email-tips-to-increase-your-productivity.html) in the morning can cast you adrift on the choppy seas of other people’s’ demands. Instead, when you sit down at your desk, fire up your laptop and get to work on the tasks you know you need to tackle. Once you’ve made some headway or completed those, then check your inbox.

### Unsubscribe to Newsletters

Yes, we all love subscribing to newsletters we think will make us better informed and more productive workers. But how many of them do you actually read? Let’s face it, most newsletters are just distractions that clutter your inbox every day and make more work for you by forcing you to open them, delete them or even possibly, read them? Go on an unsubscribing binge to cut down on the amount of clutter that reaches your inbox every day.

### Delegate

Don’t be a hero. Trying to take on everything yourself might seem admirable. However, biting off more than you can chew can leave you swimming in the deep end without a life preserver. And if you start to go under, you’ll take all your unfinished tasks down with you. Never be afraid to delegate to others. Focus on what your job is, and reach out to other team members for help on things that fall within their jurisdictions.

### Tune Out the News

We all want to keep track of current events, whether it’s business news, politics, current events, or (admit it) sports and entertainment. But let’s face it, the news can be a tremendous time suck. When you really want to get things done, ignore the news for a while. If something really major happens, you’ll be bound to hear about it. You can always catch up on the news later in the car ride home.

### Take Breaks

It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that taking a break is one of the best ways to be more productive. But no one can go all out every day without coming down with a serious case of burnout. The [highest-performing people](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/09/science-tells-you-how-many-minutes-should-you-take-a-break-for-work-17/380369/) tend to work for 52 consecutive minutes followed by a 17-minute break. Regardless of how busy you are, find time during the day to get up from your desk, take a walk around the block, eat some cookies, stop and smell the roses or whatever. It will ultimately make you more productive and better able to get stuff done.

### Bring Your Dog to Work

Having your pet at work can seem like an added distraction. After all, pets require walking, feeding and attention. But having a dog around has been [proven in studies](http://www.inc.com/john-mcdermott/study-office-dogs-reduce-work-related-stress.html) to boost the mental well-being of workers at the office. Office dogs provide warmth, a momentary reprieve from stress and another excuse to get up from your desk and stretch your legs.

### Start Off Your Day with Exercise

Exercising in the morning before work [has been proven](http://www.boston.com/dailydose/2013/03/07/ways-exercise-can-boost-your-mental-performance/nI4DA55GaKDZbdrAk9EmiO/story.html) to be one of the best ways to increase your focus and be more productive during the day. Exercising before work triggers an endorphin release that will make you more relaxed, focused and in better shape to tackle your day.

### Follow the Two-Minute Rule

If something takes two minutes or less, just do it. This will enable you to clear a lot of things from your to-do list right away. As a result, you’ll be more productive throughout the day without a lot of little niggling tasks hanging over your head. Taking care of the little things will also enable you to [be more organized and better manage your time.](http://www.vorex.com/success-on-a-shoestring-3-strategies-for-time-strapped-business-leaders/)

### Turn Off Alerts

These days, we get notifications for almost everything: emails, instant message, social media, — you name it. While it’s good to keep tabs on what’s going on in your digital life, all these alerts can be distracting and take you out of “the zone.” When it’s time to really buckle down and get things done, shut off your alerts to preserve your focus.

### Stay Hydrated

While most of us power through our days on some combination of coffee, tea or energy drinks, it’s important to balance your caffeine intake with plenty of water. Working in an air conditioned office under fluorescent lights is dehydrating anyway, especially when you throw in all that caffeine you’re drinking! Also, drinking water gives you an excuse to get up from your desk every couple of hours to use the bathroom.

### Don’t be Afraid to Say “No”

Everyone loves a team player, but biting off more than you can chew is no good for you or anyone else. If you’ve got a full plate, don’t be afraid to say so. Be assertive and don’t be afraid to say “no” to a task when you’ve already got more than you can handle. The odds are there’s someone else on your team with the bandwidth to take it on.
