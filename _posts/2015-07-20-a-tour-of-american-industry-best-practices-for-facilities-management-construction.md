You don&#8217;t have to go much farther than your kitchen to realize that daily life is markedly different than it was even 10 years ago. From [a refrigerator&#8217;s ability to update an electronic grocery list](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/) on its owner&#8217;s behalf to a supply chain that might include more than 12 countries, the world is growing increasingly more complex.<!--more-->

Global connectedness and [the illumination that connectedness provides](https://www.ted.com/talks/susan_etlinger_what_do_we_do_with_all_this_big_data?language=en) are definite pluses of the ongoing technological revolution. Managing them, however&#8211;especially in facilities management (FM) and construction&#8211;can be anything but simple.



Best practices in today&#8217;s business environment should incorporate technology&#8217;s promise of: faster, better, smarter, more. With [more than 6 million people](http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iag23.htm) currently employed within construction in the U.S. and [FM slated to grow](http://www.iofficecorp.com/blog/facilities-management-is-one-of-the-fastest-growing-industries) to almost $400 billion by 2017, that promise has become a mandate.

From streamlining operations to bettering procurement, here are some best practices for the construction and facilities management industry that you can implement to ensure your organization stays ahead of the competition.

**Better Procurement**

To operate a successful construction or FM company, it&#8217;s essential to acquire the right amounts and kinds of goods and services at the lowest cost while still delivering on time, quality and quantity. Before big data and true software solutions, procurement often involved costly guesswork.

Order too much, and cash could be tied up in inventory. Order too little, and you&#8217;d miss out on sales. Order from the wrong supplier, and a thin profit margin might disappear in a quarter. [Rely too heavily on cutting supply costs](https://hbr.org/2004/12/building-deep-supplier-relationships), and your relationship with a supplier might be severed to your detriment.



Today, you can eliminate the guesswork that&#8217;s left you hamstrung in the past with a robust software platform that intelligently and closely tracks all your company&#8217;s procurement trends and needs.

**Efficient Resource Allocation**

One of the keys to successful project management is [efficient resource allocation](http://project-management.com/importance-of-resource-allocation-and-time-management-in-project-management/). When multiple projects, timelines and teams are the norm, knowing how each of your resources is being used is essential.

With the right software, efficient resource allocation becomes possible. You can easily see what phase every project is in, whether it&#8217;s on- or under-budget, and which employees are being over- and under-utilized. . From smarter project bidding to making hiring decisions based on real numbers and data, a solid software solution can make inefficiency a relic of times gone by.



**Streamlined Operations**

Both facilities management and construction involve a mountain of day-to-day tasks just to keep a company operational. Far too often, these daily operations involve scores of different people, software programs, protocols and the like. By making use of a professional services automation (PSA) solution, however, all those different tasks can be streamlined and taken care of via a single intuitive dashboard.

Here are just some of the tasks that can be accomplished within a versatile PSA solution:

  * Invoicing and billing
  * Vendor and supplier management
  * Time and expense tracking
  * Demand planning and forecasting

Put these best practices and others like them to work by implementing a [PSA platform](http://www.vorex.com/industries/architecture-engineering-construction/) designed to move businesses like yours forward.
