We have a special affinity for the telecom industry. Our product was born from a desire to solve the business management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) needs among telecom companies. Just today, we announced <a href="http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-launches-erp-and-business-management-solution-for-telecom-companies-improving-operations-and-efficiency-on-one-single-platform/" target="_blank">general availability</a> of our project-centric ERP solution that addresses the complete lifecycle of the telecom industry.<!--more-->

From backhaul to tower construction and maintenance to end-user service and support, Vorex helps organizations scale and diversify operations with a host of business management and ERP <a href="http://www.vorex.com/industries/telecommunications/" target="_blank">features</a>, all on a single platform.

We also recently became members of the <a href="http://www.questforum.org/" target="_blank">QuEST Forum</a>, a global association that unites and improves the information and communications technology (ICT) industry. In fact, we&#8217;re the only complete, cloud-based ERP solution of its kind in the Forum&#8217;s member ranks.

Spending all of this time in telecom prompted us to reflect on the current state of the industry and take a closer look at three of the top trends we&#8217;re seeing.

**Competition is Rising&#8230;**

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrymagid/2013/03/19/households-abandoning-cable-and-satellite-for-streaming/" target="_blank">More and more consumers continue to flock to online streaming services</a> to get their favorite TV show fix. Favoring Hulu, Netflix, Amazon and Roku over traditional cable or satellite TV, customers are now a harder sell for good old-fashioned pay TV. Telecom providers are likely to get more competitive with each other as they fight to win back a piece of the pie that&#8217;s slowly being eaten away by streaming services.

**&#8230;So, staying ahead of the game is essential**

With competition heating up, it&#8217;s essential that telecom companies have a system in place to successfully achieve and manage growth. Running a telecom company is fraught with challenges, tight timelines, complex projects and long days. All of these obstacles leave little time for strategizing, focusing on the big picture and moving your business forward.

Implementing a <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/" target="_blank">business management solution</a> is key to managing day-to-day operations so you can spend time on the &#8220;big fish.&#8221; Vorex&#8217;s project-focused ERP and business management solution was designed to address the complete lifecycle of the telecom industry to help organizations meet ever-changing regulatory, demand and economic drivers, all on a single platform. A tool like Vorex will help you stay one step ahead of your competition.

**The Internet of Things (IoT) Becomes RealityÂ **

Some think that the age of <a href="http://bigthink.com/think-tank/ces-2015-internet-of-things" target="_blank">the IoT has finally arrived</a>, and customers are slowly beginning to understand its implications for their everyday life. The connected car and home are slowly becoming reality in the minds of customers and thought leaders.

And you know what they both needs to succeed? Dependable, reliable and robust connections (both LTE and WiFi), which are predicted to be the bread and butter for telecom carriers in 2015. Expect players in telecommunications to pay close attention to the evolution of the IoT and how they can capitalize on this evolving trend.

The telecom industry is near and dear to our heart. Our growing roster of telecom clients helps us ensure that we keep a finger on the pulse of industry trends and that our solution continues to help your businesses thrive.
