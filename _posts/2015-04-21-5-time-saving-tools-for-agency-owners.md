You show up to work and the office phone rings. Your cell phone is constantly buzzing with beeps and notifications, and when you open your email, it&#8217;s flooded with a seemingly never-ending stream of new messages.

Flipping to your calendar is no better because your entire day is booked back-to-back with internal and client-facing meetings. Not to mention, the end of the month is approaching which means it&#8217;s time to calculate expenses, bill clients and pay out employees.<!--more-->

Running a service-based agency is hard work, which is why most successful agency owners rely on time-saving tools to streamline day-to-day processes and stay organized.

Here are five automation tools that keep busy agency owners organized and on track for success:

**Project management software**

Project management software facilitates easy communication between  team members regarding the specifics of project schedules, timelines, budgets, expenses and other critical information that&#8217;s relevant to decision-making.

The software works by capturing project vitals in one space so that important items don&#8217;t end up lost on sticky notes, in email chains and individual filing systems. Business owners and project managers gain a holistic view of projects and are able to communicate with team members and keep an eye on project updates without the need for meetings.

It also enables team members to access information about a project in a single location. Increased transparency &#8211; in comparison to emails, memos and traditional meetings &#8211; makes it easier for project managers to receive feedback and input from the entire team. Finally, project management software speeds the pace of work and increases decision-making agility by giving everyone real-time updates on project statuses.

**Time and expense tracking applications**

Agency owners who are able to accurately predict how much time their team is spending on projects are also able to accurately predict the amount of new work their teams can take on, as well as how long that new work will take to complete. This results in the ability to better estimate quotes, staffing needs and profit margins&#8211;a prerequisite to an agency&#8217;s success.

Instead of estimating the time it takes to complete a project, agency owners can use a time and expense tracking application to automate guesswork and immediately increase billing accuracy.

What&#8217;s more, the accuracy of a time and expense tracking tool gives agency owners insight into how much work their team can perform in a given amount of time. This information can be used to estimate the price of future projects and the resource allocation needs of the agency.

**Billing and invoicing software**

Billing clients can be time consuming when expense tracking isn&#8217;t executed accurately. The most fitting billing and invoicing applications integrate with time and expense tracking applications to automatically tally hours as expenses at the end of a pay period.

Billing and invoicing software saves agency owners time &#8211; and perhaps more importantly, it gives agency owners peace of mind &#8211; by automatically calculating and organizing debts and assets. Billing and invoicing software also more accurately captures hours and expenses across projects and accounts, which helps avoid situations related to over- and under-billing clients.

**Resource allocation features**

Within project management software, agency owners should look for resource allocation tools such as scheduling and resource measurement. While it&#8217;s useful to have a place to view up-to-date project progress, the best way to save time is to allocate the use of future time.

Resource measurement tools like time and expense reporting allow team leaders to predict what they will need for future projects in the way of man-hours. Scheduling tools then allow agency leaders to allocate those hours by assigning tasks to individual team members.

Resource allocation features save money by enabling agency leaders to plan ahead both in terms of the project and financially.

**Customer relationship management system**

Customer relationship management (CRMs) systems organize and track lead and customer interactions, sales processes, marketing efforts, customer service and technical support interactions. CRMs automate sales workflows, help utilize standards in account management and establish a consistent marketing process. Through organization alone, they save agency owners time and provide insight into the lifecycle of a customer.

CRMs also give agency owners insight into the best time to contact prospects and who their most profitable clients are. That information gives decision makers the ability to optimize the use of their resources by only contacting prospects when it will advance a sale, for example. Ultimately, CRMs help agency owners streamline time management by quantifying the value of client interactions.

Business owners are busy, and monitoring project progress via meetings isn&#8217;t the best use of time. Not to mention, allocating resources is tricky when expenses are estimated. This is where project management software comes in to help agency owners streamline communications and stay caught up on project progress without needing to attend every meeting.

Time and expense tracking tools, billing and invoicing software, scheduling applications and CRMs make it possible for agency owners to precisely allocate their resources and plan ahead financially.

Make the most of today&#8217;s business management tools to save time and money and increase the efficiency of your overall organization.
