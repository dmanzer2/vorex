One of the biggest challenges facing up-and-coming digital agencies is how to grow their businesses as smoothly as possible.This can often involve trying to balance <a href="http://www.docurated.com/all-things-productivity/33-ad-agency-experts-reveal-single-biggest-mistakes-challenges-ad-agencies-face-scale" target="_blank">scaling up to attract bigger clients</a> with tracking existing accounts without creating big inefficiencies along the way.

The project-based nature of marketing keeps managers focused on what they need in the current moment to stay on track. But it can make looking ahead and predicting what will be necessary to grow and sustain that growth over time difficult.<!--more-->

You and your team can only get so much done in a day. Knowing that, it&#8217;s pretty clear that scaling is always going hand-in-hand with hiring. Who you hire, and <a href="http://adage.com/article/digitalnext/growth-killing-digital-agencies/295441/" target="_blank">what kinds of roles they will play in your agency</a>, will have a major impact on whether or not your growth is healthy and sustainable.

However, knowing what your revenue will be down the line and how much payroll you&#8217;ll be able to afford to carry can be difficult.

It&#8217;s often said that one of the keys to predicting the future is understanding the past. But understanding your past projects as you remember them is not the same as having access to organized, impartial data that can help you see exactly <a href="http://www.vorex.com/why-erp-is-a-must-for-project-based-businesses/" target="_blank">how your time and resources were utilized day-by-day, project-by-project.</a> With the insights online project management tools provide, your hindsight can really be 20/20.

### Getting a Clear Picture

When you&#8217;re running a growing digital agency, trying to keep diverse clients happy and close new business, it can be challenging to keep track of things that might not seem relevant in the moment.

That&#8217;s where project management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software can help clear your vision. They can help you visualize data across all your clients so <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/resource-allocation/" target="_blank">you can see emerging trends and insights </a>you might otherwise miss trying to keep all the balls in the air yourself.

ERP software can help you forecast your costs and expenses well enough to make informed hiring decisions based on hard data. However, the value of such software increases exponentially when combined into <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/01/27/five-catalysts-accelerating-cloud-erp-growth-in-2015/" target="_blank">a complete, cloud-based package</a>.

Once you can see exactly how you&#8217;re using your time and resources presently, you&#8217;ll be better equipped to understand how you&#8217;ll need to change in order to grow.

### Growing Smarter

Plotting your next steps can be tough. Even with the insights that online project management and ERP offer, there&#8217;s always risk involved in growth.

But leveraging that risk against <a href="http://www.vorex.com/5-reasons-a-project-planning-tool-can-make-the-difference-between-a-good-marketing-campaign-and-a-great-one/" target="_blank">data-driven insights</a> can be the difference between your biggest year ever and stagnation, or even worse, downsizing. Online resource management tools can help you direct your growth intelligently so you can make the right decisions for your agency.
