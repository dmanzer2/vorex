Summer is a great time for travel – from family vacations to extended weekend road trips, there is something about the warmer temps that inspires wanderlust. hile you and your employees are planning time away from the office, it might be the perfect time to get your business travel-ready as well.

Moving some of your solutions to the cloud can help make your business more portable. With files and infrastructure available anytime from anywhere, employees can access their office even when they’re not behind a desk.

If you’ve been thinking about moving some of your business to the cloud but are still on the fence, our 5-minute guide can help answer your lingering questions.

**Who?**

Your business shouldn’t always follow the pack, but when a good idea emerges, there’s no shame in adopting it. So, is moving to the cloud the wave of the future?

Two years ago, [*Forbes* reported that 54%](http://www.forbes.com/sites/reuvencohen/2013/04/16/the-cloud-hits-the-mainstream-more-than-half-of-u-s-businesses-now-use-cloud-computing/) of companies were already using some type of cloud service. A year later, IBM’s General Manager for Global Technology Services for North America Philip Guido pointed out that [85% of new software being developed is being built for the cloud](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ibm/2014/10/30/a-more-connected-world-how-the-cloud-is-boosting-global-travel-and-trade/).

And those businesses taking advantage of cloud-based services range from large to small and span many industries. Guido cites insurance company The Hartford, grocery company Delhaize America, and education leader Pearson as examples of companies that have successfully integrated cloud-based software and/or services into their business models.

Meanwhile, *Forbes* predicts that [78% of U.S. small businesses will have fully adopted cloud computing by 2020](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2015/05/04/roundup-of-small-medium-business-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2015/), which will more than double the current 37% that have done so.

**What?**

If you’re not exactly sure what the cloud is, you’re not alone. Googling “What is the cloud?” brings up nearly 600,000,000 results. While you might not be able to explain exactly what the cloud is, you’re probably already using it in your daily online life.

Put simply, [the cloud is a series of servers that store information and applications](http://mashable.com/2013/08/26/what-is-the-cloud/), and it’s been around since the 1950s. Instead of installing software on your computer or keeping all your files saved on a local drive, the cloud lets you access your data and software anywhere with an Internet connection. If you use an [email service like Gmail or Yahoo or if you post to social media](http://www.gcflearnfree.org/what-is-the-cloud), you’re already using the cloud.

**Where?**

The beauty of the cloud is that you can use it anywhere, as long as you have an Internet connection.

If you’re part of the [88% of organizations](http://www.worldatwork.org/waw/adimLink?id=73920) that offer some type of telecommuting to employees or if you have off-site contractors, this is great news for you. Using cloud-based software makes it easier than ever for remote team members to be on the same page as those in the office.

Switching to the cloud also makes it easier to offer telecommuting options to your employees, a benefit that’s in high demand. Additionally, being cloud-based won’t [limit your talent pool when you’re hiring](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/237960) – location doesn’t matter anymore.

**When?**

Unlike traditional software systems, cloud-based solutions don’t require [heavy IT support and infrastructure](http://www.salesforce.com/uk/socialsuccess/cloud-computing/why-move-to-cloud-10-benefits-cloud-computing.jsp). That’s great news for smaller businesses that can’t afford the costs associated with additional staff and equipment. Most cloud-based services have more flexible system requirement than their on-premise counterparts, which means you don’t need to upgrade equipment every time the software updates.

An added bonus? You automatically have access to the latest version of the software, eliminating the need to download product upgrades or purchase new versions to keep up with product evolution.

Cloud-based systems are also scalable and work just as well for large companies. Thanks to the flexibility of using the cloud, your software can now keep up with your business, eliminating costly and disruptive software shifts as your company grows and changes.

**Why?**

As you can see, there are a lot of benefits to moving more of your work to the cloud, but for many business owners this reason might be the most compelling: It saves you money.

Gone are the days of [needing a server room](http://www.salesforce.com/uk/socialsuccess/cloud-computing/why-move-to-cloud-10-benefits-cloud-computing.jsp), which is expensive to set up and adds quite a bit of space to your office needs. If a company computer is damaged, there’s no need to pay for expensive data recovery because everything on the cloud is just a download away.

And, with the automatic updates and tech support many cloud-based services provide, your company may not need an IT staff, or the IT personnel you do have can tackle larger, more ambitious projects than installing software.

Implementing a business management solution that operates in the cloud can help you grow your business successfully.
