Completing projects on-time and on-budget — and knowing when you can take on new work — requires careful oversight of who is doing what in your organization.

Having the right resources available to complete any project is only part of the equation–how you distribute and balance those resources also plays a major role in success. [Resource allocation](http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/resource-allocation) is an ongoing process that relies on shrewd management to stay flexible and react to changing situations.<!--more-->

Managing your resources well can even give you a leg up on competitors who have more to work with and can [take your organization to the next level](http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-a-leader-in-cloud-based-psa-solutions-announces-customer-agreement-with-alere-health-to-be-its-resource-utilization-software-provider/). Let’s take a quick look at some of the key terms, techniques and ideas on which better resource allocation systems are built.

**Resource Allocation Defined**

In [the simplest terms](http://www.investorwords.com/4218/resource_allocation.html), resource allocation is “the process of allocating resources among the various projects or business units.” Every organization has access to a finite amount of staff, money, physical resources, etc. at any given time, and these resources have to be spread amongst all ongoing projects and operational tasks to ensure everything is well supported.

The balancing act of shifting resources from one project to another, deciding what areas to grow and which to scale back, and calculating how everything can be accomplished efficiently with what’s on hand is the fundamental challenge of resource allocation. How effectively you manage this process can be a make or break factor for many organizations.

**Systems of Control**

Great resource management is all about finding the best fit, the Tetris-esque arrangement of all the moving parts that keeps every project fueled and outfitted without any waste. Doing this well depends on your ability to [identify all the resources](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/corporate_finance/unearthing_the_sources_of_value_hiding_in_your_corporate_portfolio) you have on hand and [easily moving those resources](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/managing_in_uncertainty/dynamic_management_better_decisions_in_uncertain_times) as needed.

Depending on the size of your organization, that can be a pretty big ledger to balance — especially if you’re trying to manage everything without the help of resource allocation software.

Spreadsheet-based solutions can be clunky and difficult to turn quickly, so many people believe the best way to manage resource allocation is to keep everything in their head to remain as flexible as possible.

Trying to keep all the balls in the air yourself without any support is a very risky proposition, and things can easily slip through the cracks. Luckily, there are robust, easy-to-use software solutions that can make resource management easier, better, and more efficient.

**Software Solutions are the Key**

Managing resource allocation without a software system in place is an unnecessary risk that can have disastrous results. Software systems can [help alleviate the over-allocation of resources](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/the-keys-to-resource-allocation/) that has become commonplace and help keep projects grounded, with realistic, data-backed expectations.

Users can accurately [track their entire resource pool at once](http://www.vorex.com/stop-bootstrapping-pinching-pennies-is-costing-you-business/), keeping tabs on every moving part as they shift from project to project, and help managers understand the effectiveness of their allocation strategies over time.

By transitioning to [a software-based resource allocation system](https://www.comindware.com/platform/resource-allocation-how-to-properly-plan-resources-within-your-company/), you’ll be able to interlock staffing, budgeting, time management and more into one complete picture that helps you see what’s working and what needs work. Once you’re able to easily see the bigger picture accurately, better decision making and resource management will be within your grasp.

Resource allocation doesn’t need to be complicated.
