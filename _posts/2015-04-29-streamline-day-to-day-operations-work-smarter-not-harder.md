Diligence, hard work and determination are characteristics that many employers consider valuable. But a strong will isn’t enough to be considered an excellent employee, CEO, manager or even a valuable team member. To complete your work daily while still having time to take account of the “bigger picture” and make strategic decisions, working intelligently is necessary.

Smart decision making relies on knowing what items need your attention *now* and which ones can be prioritized for later. In addition, finding ways to automate routine tasks and create efficient workflows will free up more time for strategizing and bigger picture thinking that can lead to more impressive results. Free up some time for the big picture stuff by streamlining these work-related processes.

**Consolidate Communication**

Segment off two to three chunks of time a day that are dedicated to checking and responding to email. Email is distracting and will take you off on tangents that make it harder to complete the task at hand. When communicating with others, keep your message to a minimum.

Instead of sending a co-worker, vendor or teammate several messages, organize all the information you need into a single email whenever possible. Save up requests and send them in a bulleted list in a daily wrap up message. This will keep back and forth communication to a minimum, and it will prevent miscommunications.

While it’s important to ensure everyone working on a project understands what’s expected of them and if changes in goals and timeline occur, frequently sending directives and updates is inefficient.

Using [project management software](http://www.vorex.com/media/new-vorex-winter-2015-release-simplifies-online-project-management-for-smbs-and-professional-services-organizations/) is the best way to streamline communication and keep everyone working on a project informed as to its progress. Project management tools enable everyone on a team to access pertinent information on their own time.

**Keep Meetings Brief**

It’s important to check in with your team routinely. However, attention spans are short. You’ll get more mileage out of your group chats or meetings if you host them frequently, but keep them brief. More frequent communication enables people to voice questions before a miscommunication slows down the a project’s progress.

To shorten the duration of your group chats or face-to-face meetings, use project management software [to assign schedules automatically, bill clients accurately, and establish sales and marketing workflows with customer relationship management (CRM) tools](http://www.vorex.com/growth-versus-maintenance/).

**Gauge Your Effectiveness**

When managing a project, a team or an entire organization, it’s important to build feedback loops into your processes. Feedback allows you to take a step back and gauge what you’re doing well — and what you can do better. [Use a CRM tool](http://www.vorex.com/free-trial/) to quantify which customers are the least expensive to acquire and the most profitable over the life of their relationship with your business.

Getting feedback from your teammates and peers is also useful to the overall business strategy. Build in time to listen to the ideas of others in your organization who perform different tasks than you do.

Crowdsourcing (within your organization) minimizes the burden of select individuals, and it [gives others an opportunity to share their unique perspective](http://www.fastcompany.com/3022299/why-this-company-is-crowdsourcing-gamifying-the-worlds-most-difficult-problems).

**Automate Tedious Tasks**

Don’t spend time manually doing tasks that can be automated. Specifically, avoid spending *any* time paying bills or estimating the hours your team worked on a project.

Instead, increase the accuracy of your calculations and save time by using [a time and expense tracking tool](http://www.vorex.com/free-trial/) to automate the billing process. Be sure to choose a time and expense tracking system that integrates with your payroll software. Finally, use a bank that automatically deducts monthly payments you owe like the office rent, utilities and so on.

**Work Smarter, Not Harder**

Growing a business and strategizing career moves will help an organization or individual advance from their present situation into a better one. While operational tasks must be maintained, they are not the most important part of work.
