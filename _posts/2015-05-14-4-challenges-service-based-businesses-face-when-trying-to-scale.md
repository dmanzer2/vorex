Service businesses often start small with a few talented and disciplined individuals working together around the clock. As the organization grows, leaders experience a slew of obstacles that can sabotage the organization’s chances of success.

Whether it’s changing management needs, figuring out how to maintain high-quality work or carrying on the vision of the organization as the team grows, implementing the right strategies when trying to scale is one of the greatest obstacles small organizations face.

These four challenges represent a few of the more common ways small, serviced-based organizations falter while growing.

**1. Lack of engagement**

As most service-based organizations grow, it is almost inevitable that employees will:

* Have to work remotely sometimes
* Collaborate across teams
* Need someone to manage daily operations
* Land in different roles than where they started

One of the bigger challenges inherent with growth is maintaining the engagement of the brains running the operation. Long-term team members bring invaluable knowledge and experience to a team, so it’s important that as employees work from home, or in a different role altogether, that they remain motivated and engaged.

Among other strategies, leaders can keep tabs on the increasing or decreasing productivity of their team by measuring the time it takes to complete a project. Implementing the use of [time and expense tracking software](http://www.vorex.com/5-time-saving-tools-for-agency-owners/) is an easy, standardized way for leaders to measure the productivity of their organization.

**2. Not managing client expectations**

Rapidly growing organizations sometimes encounter the “good problem” of having a larger-than-life reputation that precedes their work. In such cases, clients hire a company with the hope that the popular organization will perform business magic.

It’s necessary for rapidly growing service-based businesses to manage client expectations by clarifying from the outset of the relationship what their services will accomplish… and what they won’t. There’s little more frustrating on either side of the equation than unfulfilled expectations or a bar that’s set too high.

**3. Failure to invest in account management**

The larger a company becomes, the more it needs an account management procedure. Relying on the instincts of individuals not only makes an organization vulnerable to disorganization, but it also limits visibility into opportunities for improvement.

Organizations that want to be proactive and not just reactive when servicing clients can improve transparency and organization with the use of project management software.

Software makes it possible for all aspects of client management to be standardized, scheduled and evaluated by an entire team. The added bonus — it enables business owners and project managers to quickly get an overview of where each project stands at any moment.

**4. Choosing the wrong platforms**

The rate at which new technology is rolled out makes it impossible to keep up with every new product and platform. This is why it’s important that growing organizations take the time to evaluate the exact tasks that can be automated to [truly save time](http://www.vorex.com/product/), as well as the tools that could end up complicating procedures more than they will simplify, before adopting software that could be obsolete in six months.

Growth for any company entails evaluating where and why it makes sense to spend time and money. A best bet is to look for tools that can help simplify processes, improve communication and keep profit margins high.
