**A Different Approach**\*\*

\*\*

After many years working with large, resource-rich corporations such as Bank of America and Sprint, [Vorex founder and CEO Michael Salem](http://www.vorex.com/about/) identified a way he could bring some of those enterprise-level resources to the small to mid-sized business (SMB).

In 2007, Salem left a job as the assistant vice president of Bank of America’s Dallas office to start developing Vorex. He had 20 years of experience at large companies like Bank of America and Sprint, where having the right resources to complete the job generally wasn’t a problem.

But for smaller companies looking for technology solutions to help manage projects, there weren’t great options. The software used by large companies was often too expensive for smaller companies; but the more affordable options didn’t offer all the features they needed.

Salem realized there had to be a way to give SMBs tools that would help them operate like a larger business, without the high price tag.

**Ask First, Design Second**

Before work began on Vorex, Salem and his team did something novel–they asked their future customers what they needed. Rather than design and build features that clients wouldn’t use but would still have to pay for, the Vorex team focused on building the features customers actually want and building those features well.

Adopting a [design-driven](http://dmi.site-ym.com/?WhatisDesignThink) approach, Salem was implementing a development strategy being used by top businesses. Companies like [Nike](http://blog.usabilla.com/many-a-little-makes-a-mickle/) and [Apple](http://www.altitudeinc.com/apple-is-winning-the-war-with-android-why-user-centric-design-is-key/) have used customer-centered practices to win success among customers and business experts.

User-focused development has proven to be successful among clients. A 2014 [Design Management Institute](http://www.dmi.org/) study found that over the past decade design-driven companies [outperformed the Standard & Poor’s 500 by 228%](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3026287/study-good-design-really-is-good-for-business).

Based on that feedback and the knowledge gleaned from experts in professional services automation, Vorex was born.

**Beyond Basics: Strategic Feature Sets**

While Vorex handles all the business basics–project management, time and resource tracking, invoicing–that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Additional features business owners asked for were incorporated strategically to address the issues that keep managers and organization heads too bogged down to focus on growing their business.

The [time tracking](http://www.vorex.com/product/time-expense-tracking/) and [billing tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/billing-invoicing-tracking/), for example, work together to create automatic invoices that are ready to send to clients.

These features free SMB owners from having to hire someone–or spend their own time–[collecting timesheets](http://www.vorex.com/the-1-hack-for-capturing-billable-hours-without-error/), inputting the information, and then adding up hours to create an invoice.

**Plenty of Features, Plenty of Savings**\*\*

\*\*

Cost is a concern for any business, but especially for SMBs. Salem and his team responded to concerns about the bottom line by developing a cloud-based platform.

Opting for a cloud-based system eliminates the need to repeatedly purchase the newest version of software. And, if your team isn’t all in one location, a cloud-based solution enables everyone to standardize on the same technology and have access to a single version of company files and data.

Starting with the customers in mind and being a design-driven company is why Vorex is able to provide a superior experience and scale with customers as they grow.

Implementing a business management solution that streamlines and automates day-to-day operations will ensure that no hour-or dollar-gets left behind.
