Professional services automation (PSA) solutions can deliver unparalleled value to any organization.

Designed to manage time and billing, as well as resource and project management, PSAs give managers time to focus on the projects at hand. That&#8217;s why when it comes to keeping <a href="http://searchenterprisewan.techtarget.com/definition/managed-service-provider" target="_blank">costs in check and improving efficiency</a>, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) have good reason to look for the best PSA available. <!--more-->

&#8220;Firms are facing a lot of competitive pressure,&#8221; noted Jeff Kaplan, managing director of <a href="http://thinkstrategies.com/" target="_blank">Thinkstrategies Inc</a>., a consulting firm based in in Wellesley, Mass. &#8220;They have to operate more efficiently.&#8221;

And staying a step ahead of the competition isn&#8217;t even the only incentive to adopt a PSA solution. With a good PSA, billable utilization can be improved by <a href="http://spiresearch.com/downloads/whitepapers/evaluating-psa-white-paper.pdf" target="_blank">anywhere from five to 10 percent</a>, resulting in thousands of dollars in savings.

So you wanted the best, you got the best. Here are five key characteristics found in high-quality, top-tier PSA solutions:

### Ease-of-Use

You could opt for the most expansive&#8211;and expensive&#8211;PSA software on the market. But if it&#8217;s a pain for users and too difficult to master, you might as well not even bother.

Ease-of-use is a <a href="http://www.vorex.com/why-ease-of-use-matters-when-it-comes-to-your-psa-solution/" target="_blank">key element for any PSA solution</a>. Just because a solution offers a host of features doesn&#8217;t mean that you&#8217;ll need every single one. In fact, a cluttered system could make employees and customers reluctant to adopt the new workflow additions. Most importantly, your PSA should be able to <a href="http://www.vorex.com/the-top-4-reasons-why-integrations-are-vital-for-psa-solutions/" target="_blank">integrate seamlessly into existing systems</a>, as well as other key solutions such as remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools or accounting software, to limit the need for re-education and adoption of new software.

### Stellar Customer Service Enhancements

With more than <a href="http://www.channelinsider.com/blogs/cloud-computing/taking-psa-and-rmm-into-the-cloud.html/" target="_blank">50 percent of cloud service providers</a> already utilizing some form of managed service solution, PSAs are already well on their way to revolutionizing the world of customer-facing industries. Quality customer service is a <a href="http://www.vorex.com/4-ways-stellar-service-desk-ticketing-can-grow-your-business/" target="_blank">tried-and-true path to sustainable growth</a>, and PSA solutions can help <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/help-desk-and-ticketing/" target="_blank">initiate and close service tickets</a> quickly and easily.

A sophisticated PSA gives help desk providers high levels of customization&#8211;and even grants customers the ability to <a href="http://www.vorex.com/how-a-good-psa-positively-impacts-customer-service/" target="_blank">view the status of open service tickets</a>. In an age of self-service and short attention-spans, sometimes having the option to bypass a call is the best thing you can provide.

### Flexible Offerings

A <a href="http://www.vorex.com/how-a-good-psa-user-interface-ui-impacts-your-success/" target="_blank">good PSA user interface</a> makes available a variety of tools like <a href="http://www.vorex.com/characteristics-of-a-modern-erp/" target="_blank">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</a>, <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/customer-relationship-management/" target="_blank">customer relationship management (CRM)</a>, project accounting, timesheet and expense management, and analytics&#8211;while limiting unnecessary or vanity features.

The idea is <a href="http://www.bsminfo.com/doc/top-most-overlooked-professional-services-automation-psa-features-0001" target="_blank">scalability</a>: ensuring your PSA has the tools you need now and the ability to evolve as your needs change. As your customer base grows or you encounter new challenges, the flexibility of adding functionality to enable new processes becomes invaluable; and with a familiar system you know and trust, not having to throw the baby out with the bathwater truly helps.

### Industry-specific Functionality

What qualifies as a top-tier PSA solution isn&#8217;t just a collection of top of the line features, it&#8217;s a set of capabilities that&#8217;s right for YOUR organization. That means a deep understanding of the specific needs of your industry. To accomplish this, your PSA should have built-in reporting capabilities &#8211;something more sophisticated than <a href="http://www.vorex.com/step-away-from-the-spreadsheets-how-diy-business-tracking-is-a-business-fail/" target="_blank">old-fashioned DIY spreadsheets.</a>

### Ongoing Support

Within the world of project automation, <a href="http://www.vorex.com/why-your-project-management-and-erp-technology-needs-an-update/" target="_blank">things change quickly</a>. And while you could always be chasing down the newest and shiniest offering, the virtue of a <a href="http://www.vorex.com/take-your-digital-organization-higher-with-a-cloud-based-solution/" target="_blank">cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</a> solution is not just that it enables on-the-go users to <a href="http://www.business-software.com/blog/5-features-psa-software/" target="_blank">login, edit and review information at their convenience</a>, it also simplifies the process of updating existing systems.
