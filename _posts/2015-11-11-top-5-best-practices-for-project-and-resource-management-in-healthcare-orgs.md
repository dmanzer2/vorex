For many healthcare organizations, staying on top of projects and resources has almost begun to rival brain surgery in terms of complexity.<!--more-->

Thankfully, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.

With the right tools at your disposal, you can minimize those complexities and keep your organization on track. Here are five best practices for project and resource managers intent on keeping their healthcare organizationsÂ operating smoothly and in the black.

### 1. Make it Visible

Regardless of the type of healthcare organization you work for, you&#8217;re undoubtedly <a href="http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/#more-1508" target="_blank">overseeing multiple projects</a> amidst a finite set of resources&#8211;including your own. In order to ensure the most efficient and productive use of resources and personnel, opt for making it all visible.

Using a &#8220;big picture&#8221; dashboard enables you to literally peer into your organization&#8217;s inner workings, like using an x-ray to find out what&#8217;s going on inside a patient. Real-time data, metrics, employee workloads, and inventory numbers become visible without switching between spreadsheets, software or data sets.

It&#8217;s a level of visibility that makes it easier for you to make good decisions regarding everything from staffing and hiring to procurement&#8211;especially if you can access the tools via <a href="http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-launches-mobile-app-for-its-business-management-platform-improving-productivity-anywhere-any-time/" target="_blank">mobile</a> devices.

### 2. Adaptation

There once was a time when everyone believed the Earth was flat. It took some time and convincing, but now we know it&#8217;s round, and most sea captains no longer live in fear of accidentally sailing off the edge of the world. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s known as adaptation, and in today&#8217;s healthcare game, adaptation is key.

Adaptability can take many forms. Maybe you hire an internal auditor to help you more quickly respond to regulatory change. Maybe you choose a <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/" target="_blank">cloud-based project management</a> tool in order to benefit from software that offers scalability. However you do it, your organization needs to be quick on its feet and ready to seize opportunities to increase revenue and cut costs by analyzing operations data efficiently.

### 3. Better Resource Allocation

There are plenty of examples of healthcare organizations failing to understand and properly allocate resources. There&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Santa-Clara-Valley-Medical-Center-Turner-Construction-323284481.html" target="_blank">Santa Clara County hospital</a> that&#8217;s losing more than $100,000 a day on an expansion project that&#8217;s over budget, overdue and still unfinished. And there&#8217;s another example in the poorly managed VA hospital in Denver that&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/veterans/final-contract-awarded-to-finish-over-budget-denver-area-va-hospital-by-2018-1.376235" target="_blank">now slated to be finished in 2018</a>&#8211;years late and over budget by more than $1 billion.

While these examples are extreme, you get the idea. To survive and thrive in today&#8217;s healthcare industry, knowing the extent of your resources and how to manage them is a prescription for success.

### 4. Comprehensive Finance Management

Healthcare finance management is about as fun as a trip to the dentist. From Medicaid and insurance claims, to state and federal legislative changes and industry compliance, the responsibilities of paying vendors and managing accounts receivable is about as fun as sitting back in the dentist&#8217;s office, opening your mouth and saying &#8220;Ahhhh.&#8221;

### 5. Choose Better Projects

Not all projects are created equal. Some have to happen. Some don&#8217;t. Some will make you money. Some won&#8217;t.

By gaining better insight into project profitability you can form a better idea of what services your organization provides that offer the highest profit margins. Providing top-notch care is a given. But by improving your overall business operations management capabilities, you can keep your organization on course and minimize the danger of sailing over the edge.
