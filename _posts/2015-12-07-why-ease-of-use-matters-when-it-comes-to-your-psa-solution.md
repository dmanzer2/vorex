The holidays are upon us, and you&#8217;re making that list and checking it twice, don&#8217;t forget to pick up a gift that can win you points with your business associates: a software solution that integrates project management (PM) and professional services automation (PSA).<!--more-->

How thoughtful of you, right? However, we&#8217;ve all been on the receiving end of a well-intentioned gift that wasn&#8217;t quite what we needed or wanted. And the same can go for PSA solutions that end up being way too complicated to use, and thus end up providing little to no value.

So how do you assure that the platform you&#8217;re about to implement will boost company performance and employee satisfaction and not go the way of the hand-knitted reindeer hat you got from Aunt Gertie last year?

Well before you commit to a business software solution, here are a few questions to ask yourself to better ensure that you wind up with an easy-to-use solution that will be widely appreciated by your team for years.

### 1. Will your employees willfully adopt the solution?

Being the new kid at school can be tough. You don&#8217;t know anyone and no one knows you. It tends to make people standoffish and insecure.

To ensure that a new PSA will be welcomed by your staff, it&#8217;s important to get a feel for whether or not solution was designed with the people who will use it in mind. As is the case with almost all new workflow additions, the PSA should be implemented into workflows gradually, with features introduced and learned in steps.

Maybe you start by having team members understand the value in utilizing <a href="http://www.vorex.com/characteristics-of-a-modern-erp/" target="_blank">enterprise resource planning</a> (ERP) for each project.

After that, <a href="http://www.vorex.com/product/customer-relationship-management/" target="_blank">customer relationship management (CRM)</a> tools, such as integrated invoicing with <a href="http://search2.quickbooks.com/t/bn/a/get-quickbooks?cid=ppc_g_Exact_QBDT_US_B_QuickBooks_Exact_Tier1_G_S_quickbooks_txt&cvosrc=ppc.google.quickbooks&matchtype=e&adposition=1t1&creative=73750516688&content=&cvo_search=1&mobile=&X1ID=~uk~&gclid=CPSdge7zlskCFYM6aQodFqIAPw&ef_id=VkrTPQAAATUcA1Rz:20151117071157:s" target="_blank">QuickBooks</a> and other software you already use.

Once your team sees you&#8217;ve given them a solution that makes their lives easier, they&#8217;ll take it easier on the &#8216;new kid.&#8217;

### 2. Will the PSA provide you with the services you&#8217;re looking for?

A good PSA solution should be a kind of project management software Swiss Army knife. It should have multiple integrated tools that are easy to use, including project management, resource management, project accounting, timesheet and expense management, and analytics.

At the same time, you want a solution that&#8217;s not overly laded with things you don&#8217;t need. Trying to wade through unnecessary or vanity features to locate the most important and often used tools is frustrating and a waste of time. So when you&#8217;re considering solutions, keep in mind that a large feature set doesn&#8217;t necessarily equate to being the most helpful.

### 3. Will the PSA integrate easily with systems you are already using?

When onboarding any new software for your organization, another important question to ask is how well the software will integrate with your existing systems? Ideally, any PSA you choose should integrate seamlessly with commonly used business software like QuickBooks, Outlook and Salesforce.

Having a solution that will easily integrate with existing systems can spare you having to spend hours building workarounds and devising other solutions.

The right PSA will enable you to increase productivity and profit. A good PSA solution makes it possible to maintain better control of your business without having to needlessly expend extra hours on time-consuming tasks. The wrong PSA solution, on the other hand, can take you in the exact opposite direction.

So before you settle on a solution, make sure you do your research and find one that will not only be easy to get up and running, but easy to use.
