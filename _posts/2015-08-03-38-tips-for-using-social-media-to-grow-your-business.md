While we normally tout the benefits of streamlined business management processes and the value of a [great tool to manage day-to-day operations](http://www.vorex.com/product/) in this space, we wanted to take some time to address other factors that can dramatically impact company growth.

Social media is to business what high-quality compost is to gardening: When you add it to your overall efforts, [it can really improve your growth](https://www.marketingtechblog.com/2014-statistics-trends-businesses-social-media/). Having a presence on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com), [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com) and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com), among other channels, enables you to interact more often with potential customers and influencers and expand your company’s reach.

But keep in mind that not all social media activity is inherently growth-centered. You should have a method to your madness, and as with any endeavour for your business, you need a strategy and clear goals in mind when setting out on any channel.

Before you tweet, like, post and hashtag, read on for tips to properly harnessing social media to grow your business.

**1. Produce valuable content.** Your customers should benefit from everything you post, but not every post should be about you or your products and services. It’s okay to retweet a [kitten gif](http://giphy.com/gifs/RQgzLsPYlzrBC) or newsworthy article.

**2. Engage with everyone, every time.** Seriously. Everyone. Every time. Your audience took the time to reach out to you, so repay their kindness. A reply, like or favorite is the currency of social media.

**3.** [**Use hashtags**](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrampton/2014/08/07/how-to-get-you-hashtag-trending/) **early and often.** This helps other social media users find your content. Use terms relevant to your product or services and target industries. Plus, you never know when something might start trending.

1. Have a strategy.\*\* There are a lot of options. [Here are six from WordStream.](http://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2014/01/09/social-media-marketing-strategies)

**5. Produce multimedia content.** Blogs, video, slideshows, articles, podcasts, audio, photo essays, comic strips… Don’t limit yourself to a single medium.

**6. Be nice. Always.** Remember, you’re representing your company, so don’t say or do anything that would cast a negative affect on your organization.

**7. Don’t ever get defensive.** Social media is a [customer service channel](https://www.zendesk.com/resources/customer-service-through-social-media/). Treat it like one.

**8. Use targeted ads.** For a little money, you can run ads that reach targeted vertical markets or other demographics.

**9. Diversify.** [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com), Facebook, [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com), LinkedIn, Twitter, [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com)–hit only as many as you can maintain an active and meaningful presence on.

**10. Use calls to action.** Entice people to click on a link to a blog post, download an eBook, sign up for a free trial or retweet to be entered into a contest. Get people engaged.

**11. Post with consistency.** Once a day is a good place to start. After you get the hang of it, increase your frequency and vary the time of day to test engagement.

\*\*

12.\*\* [**Never overpost**](http://fortune.com/2015/01/28/8-social-media-sins-that-will-get-your-company-unfriended-and-unfollowed/)**.** You don’t want to be so active that users feel like the content is spam and they unfollow you.

**13.** **Don’t sell.** But do offer incentives and promotions.

**14.** **Have** [**different profile photos**](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/241811) **for each channel.** It will make your company feel more personal.

**15.** **Treat followers like real people.** (Considering they ARE real people, this should be relatively easy.) Listen to needs and concerns, and engage on a personal level.

**16. Build relationships.** People with a personal connection to a brand make [loyal customers](http://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/08/great-brands-aim-for-customers-hearts-not-their-wallets/).

**17.** [**Work hard at it**](https://www.garyvaynerchuk.com/social-media-marketing-how-to--893962271.html)**.**

**18.** **Don’t outsource it**. But if you have to, make sure it feels and looks authentic to your brand.

**19. Resolve customer complaints.** Customers treat social media like [it’s a customer service channel](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2014/08/12/7-reasons-you-need-to-be-using-social-media-as-your-customer-service-portal/), so you should, too. Not responding in a timely fashion can often leave things worse than they were to begin with.

**20. Treat each site like it’s different from the others.** While you can post the same content – be it picture, link or text – to each site, the mediums vary, so your tone, post length and, yes, even the hashtags should, too.

**21. Start a** [**LinkedIn Group**](https://www.linkedin.com/directory/groups/)**.** Or join one that’s relevant to your industry and vertical topics.

**22.** **Measure.** Use analytics to see which posts result in the best engagement, sales, etc. and repeat those tactics, whether it’s content, keywords or even posting at particular times of day.

**23. Tackle Twitter responsibly.**  [TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) can be a powerful tool to help make sense of the more than 288 million active monthly users.

**24. Put icons everywhere.** Let customers know about your social media presence with icons on your website, business cards, email newsletters, etc.

**25. Post great photos.** The quality of your posts reflects on your brand.

**26. Always improve.** Those analytics from #22? Use them to improve your content and work to get better.

**27. Add images to tweets.** They’ll be more readily noticed and remembered. Plus, posts with images get [more engagement](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/photos-generate-engagement-research/) than those that are text-only.

**28. Make it personal.** Use names whenever possible. People want to interact with people, not corporations.

**29. Link some posts to** [**landing pages**](http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/32566/Why-Landing-Pages-Are-an-Indispensable-Part-of-Marketing.aspx). If someone wants to become a customer, make it easy.

**30. Promote other content.** Always keep  your customers in mind–what else would benefit them? Post about it.

**31. Make it special.** Offer giveaways, coupons, and other special offers on social media and nowhere else.

**32. Budget for it.** Regardless of how much you have to spend, [spend wisely](https://blog.bufferapp.com/social-media-marketing-budget).

**33. Play the long game.** Yes, you want customers to convert–but it take some time. Generating leads via social media is a slow build, but it’s worth it.

**34. Build alliances.** Find other businesses that are complimentary to yours, and cross-promote.

**35. No typos.** Have someone else proofread every post you write.

**36.** [**Handle trolls.**](http://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/social-media-trolls/)

**37. Make posts easy to share**.

**38. Follow** [**the 5-3-2** **rule**](http://www.heinzmarketing.com/2011/10/the-5-3-2-rule-for-social-media-content/).
