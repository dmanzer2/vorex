Please, sit down. We need to talk.

This is an intervention. Your friends and I have been discussing it, and while we think you&#8217;re great&#8230; Well&#8230; You really need to update your [project management and ERP solution](http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/). <!--more-->

Seriously though, it&#8217;s getting a little embarrassing watching you struggle with your old ad hoc resource planning and allocation systems. Seeing your employees fall back on [notebooks, disorganized spreadsheets and software](http://www.erpsoftwareblog.com/2012/02/old-erp-new-erp-the-age-of-your-erp-can-alter-your-bottom-line/) that doesn&#8217;t play nice with your [centralized, company-wide systems](http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/) just bums us out&#8211;and frankly, it&#8217;s costing you money.

### Does Your ERP Play Well with Others?

Let&#8217;s face it, technology is changing so fast it can make your head spin. This means that the true test of the long-term viability of any software system is [the community around it&#8211;](http://www.informationweek.com/software/enterprise-applications/6-more-enduring-truths-about-selecting-enterprise-software/d/d-id/1113070?page_number=1)who is using it, how well it integrates with existing systems, and how well it plays with third-party software.

Your project management has to be customized to match your needs and [designed to work across multiple platforms](http://www.vorex.com/top-5-ways-cloud-based-project-management-provides-a-competitive-edge/). Mac or Windows, mobile or desktop, in-the-office or work-from-home: flexibility is the name of the game, helping to ensure that your team can work within the existing framework they are most comfortable with to increase efficiency and productivity.

Compare the centralized, hyper-accessible modern software to clunky ERP hardware solutions on slow desktop computing terminals. Actually, let&#8217;s spare ourselves the trouble: the modern software is way better and much more likely to work within your present technological ecosystem.

### The Future is in the Cloud

Even if your ERP software is just a few years old, chances are it could already be outdated and outmoded. The rise of <a href="https://diginomica.com/2015/10/12/how-cloud-erp-gets-manufacturing-work-done/#.Vjlki66rSRs" target="_blank">cloud ERP solutions</a> has led to a world where project management can be hosted and accessible from everywhere, including cloud-based updating and support&#8211;which <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/blog/infographic-the-state-of-smb-cloud-adoption-in-2014/" target="_blank">51 percent of businesses</a> report saves them more time than traditional IT. This means no more calling in the IT guy every time your project management tools go on the fritz.

&#8220;Longer term, over the next 10 years and more, we envision a scenario where more of the market &#8216;flips&#8217; to the cloud,&#8221; says Nigel Rayner, <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2658415" target="_blank">research vice president at Gartner</a>. &#8220;Instead of having on-premises core solutions that are complemented by innovation or differentiating processes being supported in the cloud, some organizations will move all their ERP functionality to the cloud.&#8221;

While Gartner predicted that by 2018, &#8220;at least 30 percent of service-centric companies will move the majority of their ERP applications to the cloud,&#8221; the truth is that in nearly every industry <a href="http://www.vorex.com/take-your-digital-organization-higher-with-a-cloud-based-solution/" target="_blank">Software-as-a-Service</a> (SaaS) has been rapidly becoming the norm. <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/blog/cloud-industry-insights/cloud-computing-trends-2014-state-cloud-survey" target="_blank">Eighty-seven percent of businesses</a> are already using cloud-based solutions for project management and ERP.

### Everybody Get Together

The accessibility of modern, organized, centralized ERP solutions truly can&#8217;t be beat. They are designed to bring your team together and under the umbrella of a single software solution. Offering advanced connectivity, flexibility and customization to suit your organization&#8217;s unique needs, as well as cloud-based updating and IT support, SaaS project management will keep you ahead of the competition and [allow your business to scale effectively](http://www.vorex.com/how-online-project-management-erp-can-help-digital-agencies-advance-their-businesses/).
