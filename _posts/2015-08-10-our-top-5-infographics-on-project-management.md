Visualizing the relationships between all the moving parts of a project can be [a major challenge](http://www.vorex.com/growth-versus-maintenance/). But sometimes all it takes to put everything in perspective is a putting things down on paper – or even in digital form – in a well-crafted infographic.

Infographics’ unique ability to present information in a visually appealing, easy to digest format makes them especially useful for explaining the finer points of any issue. In that spirit, here are five project management infographics we love from around the web!

**10 Reasons the Death Star Failed**

We love this because it makes it easy to understand how abstract project management problems can manifest in our own organizations by relying on one of the galaxy’s all-time biggest failures. Everyone loves Star Wars, but don’t miss this infographic’s important messages about defining success, staying focused and, most importantly, learning from your mistakes.

**Do You Need Project Management Training?**

The title of this infographic is rhetorical, because most of us could benefit from a little training every now and then. What makes this infographic so great is the quantitative data it offers on the benefits of training, breaking down what parts of your project management can be improved and by how much.

While a little training never hurt, it’s important to [target your training](http://www.vorex.com/four-easy-ways-to-get-the-most-out-of-your-talent/) so you’re not wasting resources. By integrating training into your project management system, you can improve your overall performance and keep growth strong.

**How to Manage Projects Effectively**

This one has a bold claim right in the name, and it’s a long one to boot, but its strategies are sound and worth a read. The focus on building diverse teams and assigning tasks that fit each team member’s strengths and weaknesses well is especially valuable. Follow these easy steps, and you’ll be able to superpower your own team in no time.

**The Heart of Project Management**

This beautiful infographic from the great team at [Projectvibe](http://projectvibe.co.uk/) is short and sweet. It gets right to the core of project management, breaking it all down into the five key components needed to get your project done on time and on budget.

If you’re looking for one concise infographic to get you started, this might be the one for you. Keep in mind its scope is somewhat limited though – there’s more than one way bake a cake – which brings us to our final infographic:

**16 Popular Project Management Methodologies**

Though it’s by no means comprehensive, this list of methodologies does offer a glimpse of how many different approaches to project management there are out there. It gives you a little taste of how each methodology functions, and it’s a great jumping off point for research into new ideas.

The diversity of methodologies in the infographic also hints at the infinite possibilities for great approaches to project management and should be taken as encouragement to develop your own path if that’s what suits your needs best.
