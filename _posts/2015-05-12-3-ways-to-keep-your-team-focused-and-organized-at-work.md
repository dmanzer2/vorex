Modern life has delivered technologies that make both our work and personal lives much easier. However, the same innovations that were created to increase our productivity can end up distracting us and leading to inefficient work habits.

In fact, digital distraction is such a common problem that a [recent study](http://www.careerbuilder.com/jobposter/resources/page.aspx?template=none&amp;sc_cmp2=JP_Infographic_productivity2014&amp;pagever=productivity2014) conducted by Careerbuilder tells us that 24% of workers spend at least one hour each day on personal calls, emails or texts. (You’re not the only one with this growing problem of distraction!)

But don’t give up just yet! Here are three ways to motivate your team and help avoid distractions, remain focused, stay organized and — ultimately — work more efficiently.

**1. Automate Tedious Tasks**

We all know time is money, which is why it’s key to ensure that you and your team aren’t wasting time on tedious tasks that can be automated or outsourced.

[Project management tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/) offer automation features that take tasks such as billing, time and expense tracking and customer relationship management (CRM) off your plate so that you have time to focus on the big picture strategies that can move your business forward.

**2. Set an Email Embargo**

Let’s face it, email is the ultimate time suck in the workplace. It’s become overused (and abused), resulting in such a high volume that it can be absolutely daunting to try and tackle the pile of digital correspondence that comes flooding in every day.

Just when you’re getting into the flow of a project, your desktop alerts let you know that you have yet another group of emails from clients or coworkers that pertain to a different project altogether.

One way to organize your time and manage emails is to simply adhere to an email embargo several times a day. In other words, check your emails in the morning and respond to those that need your immediate attention.

Then, rather than sort and file the remainder of your emails, take a break. Look at your to-do list and assess your top priorities for the day. By not giving your attention to your email constantly throughout the day, you can focus on completing your top-priority tasks.

Once you have crossed an item or two off your list, give yourself permission to take another peek at your email. Repeat this process of assessing the immediacy of your emails and then taking a break from them to focus on a single task from start to finish.

**3. Stick To Regular, Structured Meetings**

Conducting regular meetings that are focused and informative is essential to the health of your organization. And as tempting as it might be to keep putting off and rescheduling meetings, it’s crucial to adhere to an organized and consistent schedule, because the more in sync your team is, the less information will need to be communicated at each meeting.

While meetings can provide vital status updates that result in strategic brainstorming and determining the next steps for a project, they can also become a huge waste of time.

So be sure to keep your meetings as brief as possible by creating (and sticking to) meeting agendas that are sent to every participant beforehand so they know what information to report and share with the team. Avoid addressing hyper-specific issues that only pertain to one department or segment of your team. These topics can be covered in one-to-one emails or conversations.
