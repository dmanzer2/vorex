Have you caught wind of the [exciting news](http://www.vorex.com/media/vorex-and-continuum-launch-platform-integration-to-streamline-ticketing-and-workflows-for-increased-time-savings-and-productivity/) yet? This morning, we announced that the Vorex platform is now officially integrated with [Continuum&#8217;s remote monitoring and management (RMM) tool](http://www.continuum.net/solutions) to help managed service providers (MSPs) run their businesses more smoothly and serve their customers better.<!--more-->

This new integration is cloud-based, easy to activate and provides seamless ticket and workflow synchronization across the two platforms. We&#8217;re all about making your life easier and more streamlined, and now MSPs have all the tools they need for better ticketing and improved customer service in _one_ consolidated location.

We&#8217;ve already heard that the integration has increased users&#8217; time savings _and_ productivity. One company has even cut their time spent managing tickets by about 70 percent!

Vorex is the first PSA vendor certified by [Continuum](http://www.continuum.net/) to implement the company&#8217;s API and makes the following scenarios (and more!) possible:

<li style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Create a ticket in Vorex, assign it to the help desk team, and the ticket will be transferred automatically to Continuum.</strong>
</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>All updates and activities will be synchronized automatically on both platforms whenever they happen.</strong>
</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>All Physical Assets attached to a ticket under Continuum will be created under Services Desk Physical Assets in Vorex as well.</strong>
</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Map all custom Continuum statuses to the Vorex system statuses with no limitations.</strong>
</li>
<li style="padding-left: 30px;">
  <strong>Assign special workflows in Vorex to run after a ticket is imported from Continuum.</strong>
</li>

These are just some of the ways that this new integration will help MSPs save time by streamlining how their RMM and PSA platforms work together. We&#8217;re so excited about what this new development means for MSPs and business managers that we&#8217;re joining forces with Continuum to be a sponsor and exhibitor at its annual [Navigate conference](http://www.continuum.net/navigate2015) in Las Vegas on Sept. 27 to 29.

We&#8217;re looking forward to participating in Navigate and meeting other vendors as well as Continuum users who can benefit from our new integration. All too often we see business owners and managers who are frustrated and being [held back from growth](http://vorex.hs-sites.com/the-msp-growth-problem-how-to-surpass-industry-expectations?__hstc=100746398.bd88e146958c2246c94c33026b36c13e.1421778420298.1442499482125.1442514549861.184&__hssc=100746398.4.1442514549861&__hsfp=2117633929) simply because of a lack of time.

We want to spread the word that a great PSA platform and this new integration can help relieve the burden of daily operational activities and give MSPs and managers the ability to focus on tasks that will move the business forward.

At Navigate 2015, we&#8217;ll be at booth 15 performing product demos and answering any questions you have about this integration and what it can do for _your_ business. There might even be a fun giveaway, so be sure to stop by. If you want to learn more about the new integration, download our free guide on the Vorex-Continuum partnership.
