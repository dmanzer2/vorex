The worlds of software and technology continue to advance and evolve at an impressive rate as modern life becomes more integrated with technology. Think about how often you use your smartphone on a daily basis. Or how widespread the [Internet of Things (IoT)](http://www.wired.com/2014/11/the-internet-of-things-bigger/) and connected devices is becoming. Software and technology are booming industries.

To stay competitive in this [increasingly complex and high-tech environment](https://hbr.org/1997/05/technology-integration-turning-great-research-into-great-products), software and tech companies need every advantage they can get. While the need for vision, research, resources and discipline is clear, these organizations also need to be run effectively, otherwise no 21st century business–regardless of its industry –can survive.

Whether you’re simply trying to stay in business, or you’re hoping to invent a technology that changes the world, knowing what’s worked in the past will help keep you working in the future. To that end, here are a handful of business management best practices for software and technology companies and startups that can ensure you’re innovating for years to come.

**Creating the Necessary**

For any software or tech company, you want to solve an existing problem instead of creating a product then trying to find a problem that it can solve. This essential to staying in business. Without it, you won’t stand a chance of yielding profitability. Whether you’re developing software that automates necessary business processes–such as [project management](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/)–or you make [wearable technology](http://www.businessinsider.com/wearable-tech-could-soon-reach-385m-people-2015-7), identify an unfulfilled consumer need before you even think about renting a warehouse or raising capital.

**Winning the Upgrade Game**

Even software and tech companies have to stay on top of changes in technology, and keeping pace with necessary upgrades [is getting more expensive](http://www.optimalnetworks.com/how-and-how-much-it-spending/) and time-consuming. Thankfully, just because you’re in the industry doesn’t mean you’re required to helm of all your own tech needs.

Skip bothering with future upgrades by outsourcing at least some of your operations to a cloud-based service provider. This enables you to have access to the latest version of the software without having to download patches or upgrades yourself.

When it comes to professional services automation (PSA), you can find an [intuitive, cost-effective platform](http://www.vorex.com/product/) that will keep you up-to-date on everything from billing and invoicing to [customer relationship management (CRM)](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-crm-ht).

**Simplicity**

To run a successful tech or software company, you need an infrastructure that allows for both [agility](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240705) and innovation. In order to provide that, you need a business management solution that’s robust, easy to access and easy to use.

Keep track of your current and projected profitability, project timelines, resource allocation and more with a consolidated, cloud-based platform. Streamlined operations enable greater efficiency, so you can grow and manage your company more effectively.

**Dynamic Communication**

[Better communication](http://blog.apterainc.com/theirs-but-to-do-and-die-why-a-lack-of-communication-will-lead-to-a-software-development-disaster) is an essential component of the most successful  companies, especially as work spreads out across departments, teams, offices and time zones. To ensure better communication, utilize a platform that allows work and communication to coexist.

Dynamic communication is distinguishable from mere memo-driven chit-chat because it’s detailed, two-way, easily tracked and timely. With a cloud-based solution that lets you see exactly who is working on which project, when and with whom, you and your team can more effectively communicate with one another to ensure the company’s goals–and its individual projects–all see the light of day.

Running a software or technology company in today’s fast-paced and competitive environment isn’t for the faint of heart. [Choose a platform](http://www.vorex.com/industries/software-technology/) that will keep your business operations humming so you can free your mind and the minds of your employees to uncover the future.
