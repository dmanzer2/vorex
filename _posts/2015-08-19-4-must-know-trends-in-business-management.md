The art and science of business management is always shifting. If you look, you can find a new method, tactic or advice published everyday on thousands of business-focused sites on the web. It can be overwhelming to keep up with it all.

But consider yourself lucky! We’ve done the legwork for you, putting together a list of four of the biggest business management trends to keep your eye on. Read on for the top ways to ensure your company stays ahead fo the competition!

**Agile Everything** — It used to be that an Agile approach to work was relegated only to development teams. SCRUM and other agile team strategies were kept to the realm of programmers trying to meet feature roll-out deadlines. But today, entire organizations are using agile approaches to keep all departments and teams within the company focused and meeting productivity demands.

**Social Business Design** — As millennials continue to represent a larger and larger portion of the workforce, business apps and communication tools have been reconsidered and redesigned with them in mind. The goal is to make business apps more appealing and more likely to be adopted by a workforce that is increasingly dependent on social media and and the social user interface for the majority of its communication.

**Employees Are Assets** — Gone are the days when employees were seen as cost centers or easily replaceable. These days, we’re working less and less in an assembly line, physical labor-based world, and the shift to a knowledge-based workforce is the driver behind companies viewing employees as assets. Each employee plays a key role on a team, and their knowledge and experience is not as easy to replace anymore.
