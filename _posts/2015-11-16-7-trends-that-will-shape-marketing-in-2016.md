Pack up the pumpkins, dust off the holiday decorations, and stick a fork in that bird, it’s done–2015, that is. Sure, we still have a few more weeks before we officially wrap up the year, but that doesn’t mean we can’t start looking ahead to some of the emerging marketing trends we can expect in 2016.

### 1. Mobile and App Marketing

The greatest marketing tool for companies is most likely [in your pocket right now](http://www.vorex.com/productivity-anywhere-any-time-with-vorexs-new-business-management-mobile-app/).

…No, not your keys.

[Smartphones, tablets and other wearable technology](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2015/04/14/10-top-trends-driving-the-future-of-marketing/) are all driving marketing innovation. Mobile usage [has already overtaken desktop traffic](http://adwords.blogspot.com/2015/05/building-for-next-moment.html), so businesses need to provide a sleek, easy-to-use mobile experience to stay competitive. And with Google app indexing, [the app market is exploding](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/09/29/the-top-7-online-marketing-trends-that-will-dominate-2016/) and is projected to overtake even the mobile experience.

### 2. Transparent Engagement

Customers are looking for more engagement from their favorite companies and brands–and greater transparency as well. This reflects a less passive role for consumers: rather than being marketed *to,* they seek brands that ask them questions and communicate honestly and openly *with* them. Consumers are looking for [genuine, authentic communication](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3043109/sector-forecasting/25-predictions-for-what-marketing-will-look-like-in-2020), and when brands deliver on that expectancy, they’ll convert brand advocates and build sales.

### 3. Video Ad Domination!

While video ads on YouTube and Facebook are nothing new, with Google finally rolling out support for [in-SERP video advertising](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jaysondemers/2015/09/25/are-video-ads-coming-to-google-search-results/), we are looking at a potential explosion of new video ads. The growing [prevalence of ad-blocking software](http://www.forbes.com/sites/valleyvoices/2015/09/23/ad-blocking-a-primer/) has made ads incredibly rare, meaning that video is emerging as one of the few organic opportunities with which to engage consumers online.

### 4. Personalized Experience and Data-driven Marketing

Everyone likes to feel special and noticed. At the same time, while businesses certainly can aim to treat every customer like a beautiful, unique snowflake, [data-driven marketing](http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/) can easily become intrusive marketing if the customer feels like they’re being sold on something–rather than having a relationship built and reinforced.

### 5. Social Media

To say we live in a social media world is a vast understatement. The truth is, [social media is everything](http://www.vorex.com/38-tips-for-using-social-media-to-grow-your-business/): it’s the hub of all communication and commerce, to the point where mentioning a “social” strategy makes a business sound painfully square. We don’t “go online” anymore, we are always online.

“Facebook now makes more money on advertising than most of the major television networks and it’s showing no signs of letting up.” says Noah Brier, co-founder of [Percolate](http://www.fastcocreate.com/3043109/sector-forecasting/25-predictions-for-what-marketing-will-look-like-in-2020). “The fact these are social doesn’t really matter anymore; they’re part of the marketing mix and offer brands the sort of reach they only got a few times a year on television. To that end, social will just be folded into the broader marketing discipline.”

### 6. 3D and Virtual Reality

With the [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/)–the most hyped virtual reality device to date–set to release in the first quarter of 2016, we could be looking at a massive paradigm shift in the way we absorb media and marketing. 3D technology has [already boosted flagging movie ticket sales,](http://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2014/11/16/why-3d-will-dominate-cinema-in-the-future/) demonstrating that viewers have a hunger for novelty in their technology.

3-D and virtual reality technology is becoming increasingly common and more widely integrated into existing platforms. Marketers cannot afford to ignore its potential.

### 7. Content is Still King

It’s good to be the king. The need for relevant, engaging content (particularly visual) shows [no sign of flagging](http://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/2015/11/03/the-top-10-marketing-trends-that-will-define-2016/2/). Consumers value storytelling and engagement over a hard sell. Getting customers to engage in direct conversation with businesses will create [brand loyalists and advocates](http://millennialceo.com/branding/branding-evolution-earning-readership-owned-media/) willing to organically spread the word and maybe even, create user generated content.

If you are hoping to be the “next big thing” (or even the “next medium-sized thing”), making sure your [project management and enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools](http://www.vorex.com/product/online-project-management/) are up to snuff is essential. With [organized, centralized ERP](http://www.vorex.com/characteristics-of-a-modern-erp/) and data insights, you can focus on keeping up the Joneses–rather than just chasing paper(trails).
