With the new year on the the horizon, experts in the <a href="http://www.vorex.com/top-5-best-practices-for-project-and-resource-management-in-healthcare-orgs/" target="_blank">healthcare industry</a> have more on their minds than cold and flu season. Healthcare is often known for making necessary shifts and adjustments in a slow-moving manner.

However, driven by disruptive innovations in technology, social dynamics and <a href="http://www.vorex.com/i-choose-you-selecting-the-best-erp-for-your-organization/" target="_blank">resource planning and management</a>, that appears to be changing, and we&#8217;re now witnessing a rapid evolution in how healthcare providers are doing business. So, without further ado, here are five healthcare trends to watch for in the coming year.

### 1. Further Integration of The Internet of Things (IoT)

Next-generation medical devices enabled with Bluetooth capabilities are taking the healthcare world by storm. _<a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/feature/Aruba-mobile-engagement-platform-wins-Network-Innovation-Award" target="_blank">iBeacon</a>,_ a low-powered, <a href="http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/opinion/Newest-generation-Bluetooth-medical-devices-can-disrupt-healthcare" target="_blank">low-cost Bluetooth and indoor positioning system</a>, has significant and possibly radical uses in medicine by potentially replacing passive radio-frequency identification and Wi-Fi as a means to keep tabs on devices, assets and even patients within medical facilities.

And with recent announcements by the <a href="http://www.toptechnews.com/article/index.php?story_id=03200101FLVK" target="_blank">Bluetooth Special Interest Group</a> promising more powerful and faster connections, medical facilities and industry professionals are more wired into the <a href="http://www.vorex.com/business-management-and-erp-address-telecoms-top-trends-of-2015/" target="_blank">Internet of Things </a>(IoT) than ever before.

### 2. Inter-network Communication and Collaboration

Healthcare networks are overcoming old challenges and <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/01/14/5-trends-that-will-redefine-your-healthcare-experience-in-2015/" target="_blank">communicating data in new and exciting ways</a>.

Susan DeVore, <a href="https://www.premierinc.com/5-trends-will-redefine-healthcare-experience-2015/" target="_blank">CEO of Premier healthcare alliance</a>, says that while networks have built up huge amounts of data in the form of e-records in recent years, those records are &#8220;not able to seamlessly talk to each other.&#8221;

But that is likely to change on &#8220;both the public and private level&#8221; very soon. Much of this change will require the streamlining of <a href="http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/" target="_blank">project management</a> tasks and the utilization of cloud solutions to access patient e-records.

### 3. Funneling SEO Traffic

According to Pew Research, <a href="http://mktgessentials.com/top-5-marketing-trends-for-healthcare-in-2016/" target="_blank">77 percent of people</a> started their search for answers to medical information by using a search engine such as Google, Bing or Yahoo. Another 13 percent say they began their search at a site that specializes in health information, like WebMD.

When staring at that weird rash in the mirror, wondering to themselves &#8220;Is it supposed to be that color?&#8221; people are far more likely to turn to their search engine than ask their local physician. Healthcare providers are likely to begin connecting with patients via search engine optimized (SEO) strategies to funnel those patients into their healthcare networks.

### 4. Performance Improvement Programs

Reviews matter and patients&#8211;for the first time&#8211;have the ability to <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/print-edition/2015/08/28/the-patient-is-not-always-right.html" target="_blank">review their healthcare experience</a>, as well as shop around for services and service providers. This has changed the market dramatically and placed a larger emphasis on providing high-quality service and healthcare experiences.

<a href="https://www.healthcatalyst.com/implementing-healthcare-performance-improvement-initiatives" target="_blank">Performance improvement initiatives</a> require not just data collection and reviewing, but also organizing that data so it&#8217;s able to provide valuable insights that can be used to improve customer service and the overall patient experience.

<a href="http://www.vorex.com/supercharging-business-insights-with-online-project-management-erp/" target="_blank">Project management and ERP solutions</a> can turn oodles of data (much of which could come directly from patients) into easily digestible and actionable provider strategies.

### 5. Improved Outcomes

Between 2010 and 2013, there was a 17 percent reduction in adverse events affecting patient health, <a href="https://www.healthcatalyst.com/top-healthcare-trends-challenges-2015/2/" target="_blank">preventing nearly 50,000 deaths</a>.

By using analytics related to patient data, healthcare organizations are able to quickly track the success and failure rates of various interventions and adjust standard operating procedures (SOPs) as needed. This will continue to lead to dramatically improved outcomes as people get healthier quicker.

Managing resources and projects internally is the key to ensuring that professionals remain on the cutting edge of industry change. With <a href="http://www.vorex.com/top-5-ways-cloud-based-project-management-provides-a-competitive-edge/#more-1440" target="_blank">project management</a> and ERP capabilities in a streamlined solution, your healthcare business can focus on delivering high-quality service and changing with the times&#8211;instead of being left behind.
